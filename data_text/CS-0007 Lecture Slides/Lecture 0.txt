A Note for CS and Other
Computing Majors
CS 0401 (Intermediate Programming in
Java) is more likely to be suitable for
you. This course is geared towards nonmajors. Talk to your academic advisor.

Syllabus
• Can be found on Courseweb

Teaching Style
• Because this course is geared towards
non-majors, the course will be taught in
a human-language inspired manner.
• However, students should recognize
that human languages are fluid and
bendable. Programming languages
(like Java) are not.

The Programming Mindset
Imagine talking to your (possibly
imaginary) non-cooperative little
brother who claims to be following
directions, but taking them as literally
as possible.
This is what it is like programming a
computer.

Regarding Collaboration
• I encourage all of you to collaborate
and learn from each other by doing the
homework.
• The only requirement: please write at
the top of your homework who you
collaborated with. Leaving this
information out while continuing to
collaborate constitutes cheating and is
NOT PERMITTED.

Regarding Plagiarism
• Plagiarism, which includes copying or
using code from any source without my
approval, is strictly prohibited.
• First offense: A zero for the graded item
• Second offense: A zero for the course
