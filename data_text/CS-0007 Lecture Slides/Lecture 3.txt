Primitive Types
NO, STRING IS NOT A PRIMITIVE

I Don't Want to Do Strings Anymore.
Isn't There Anything Else?
• Strings are okay, but
they don't do much
for us.
• What about
representing
numbers and other
things?
• We must use the
building blocks of
Java!

• Primitive Values:
–
–
–
–
–
–
–
–

boolean
byte
char
double
float
int
long
short

I Don't Want to Do Strings Anymore.

• Most useful

boolean
char
double
int

• Second tier
– byte
– long

• Primitive Values:

–

boolean
byte
char
double
float
int
long
short

boolean
• Two values only:
– true
– false

• How do we declare one?

Type name = value;

boolean name = value;

boolean yes = true;

char
• Characters in single quotation marks
• How do we declare one?

Type name = value;

char mander = 'z';

double
• Decimal numbers (not whole numbers)
• When providing a value, it must have at
least one decimal place (2 should be
2.0)
• How do we declare one?

double pi = 3.14;

int
• Integers (whole numbers)
• How do we declare one?

int zero = 0;

byte
• Special tiny whole number
• How do we declare one?

byte kiloB = (byte)127;

long
• Special larger whole number
• How do we declare one?

long timeAgo =
123456789L;

short
• Special smaller whole number
• How do we declare one?

short y = (short)-4;

float
• Special smaller double
• How do we declare one?

float away = 3.5f;

Why is String not purple?
• Why is String not a primitive value?
• What is a String made up of?
• Characters  char

WARNING
• char uses SINGLE QUOTATIONS
• String uses DOUBLE QUOTATIONS
• String can be empty! (""  legal)
• char CANNOT be empty! (''  illegal)
• Concatenation: + with only chars has a
different behavior than with Strings

Okay, Let's Do Some Stuff
Now!
public class Name
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
String firstName = "Nathan";
char midInitial = 'R';
String lastName = "Ong";
int age = 19;
boolean hasFacebook = true;
System.out.println(firstName + " " + midInitial + " " + lastName +
", age: " + age +
", has a Facebook: " + hasFacebook);
}//end method main
}//End class Name

What is the output?

Wait Whaaaaa?
• How did he add all of those things
together??? Is that even legal? Is he
cheating? He must have hacked Java.
• Concatenation with any String forces
other values to use their String
representations!
• The value 19 is now "19"!
• The value true is now "true"!
• So again, what is the output?

Hmm, no one really says "has a Facebook:
true"
Now what? How do we fix this?

Range of Values
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

boolean
– false, true
byte – -2^7, 2^7-1
char – ASCII
double– -∞, +∞; with limited precision, and NaN
(Not a Number)
float – -∞, +∞; with limited precision, and NaN
(Not a Number)
int
– -2^31, 2^31-1
long – -2^63, 2^63-1
short – -2^15, 2^15-1

This is great and all, but I really want
to be able to store more useful info
• Feels limited if we have to stay with the
Type name = value; structure
• And thus we can introduce a new
structure

Type name = expression;

boolean
• Two values only:
– true
– false

• We can also assign the variable an
expression to be evaluated.

boolean Operators
&&
||
!

– Logical AND
– Logical OR
– Logical NOT

boolean needUmb = rain || cloud;
Parentheses can be used as a way to
group

• Does not have an operator in Java
