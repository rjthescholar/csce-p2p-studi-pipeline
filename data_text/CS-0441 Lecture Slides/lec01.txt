Course meeting times
n Lecture
l B: Flex@Pitt, M/W 5:00–6:15
l C: Flex@Pitt, T/H 4:30–5:45

n Recitations
l Wednesday or Friday (see website)

n It is important to attend both lecture and your
assigned recitation section!
l (No recitations this week)

Grading
n Overall breakdown:
l 30% Midterm exam
l 30% Final exam
l 20% Homework
l 10% Recitation exercises
l 10% Lecture participation (Top Hat)
l 100%

Recitation
Recitation exercises
l Covers the previous week’s material (W–T)
l Assigned the day before recitation, due the day of your
recitation at 11:59 PM via Gradescope
l Late submissions are not accepted—submit early and often
l Two lowest exercise grades will be dropped

Recitations are collaborative
l You should try the exercises in advance of recitation
l You’ll go over much of the solutions in recitations
l Submit solutions that you understand—don’t just copy what
your TA writes or copy a friend’s submission

Homework
Weekly homework assignments
l Assigned on Friday, due the next Tuesday at 11:59 PM
l Late homework is not accepted—submit early and often
l Two lowest homework grades will be dropped

Homework may be discussed with others, but must be
solved and written up individually
l Limit discussion to understanding problems and developing
high-level solution tactics
l Canvas is a good place to do this

l Identify collaborators on your homework cover sheet
l No online resources (except Canvas)
l Failure to comply with this policy is a violation of academic
integrity (F in the course)

Policies
n Check the web page and Canvas frequently. Announcements,
homework, and lecture slides will be posted there
n We will drop your two lowest homework and recitation scores
before computing your homework average—no excuses necessary!
n Regrade requests accepted within 2 weeks of hand-back. Grade
may increase, decrease, or stay the same.
n Other policies are on the web page
l Accommodating students with disabilities
l Religious observances
l Etc.

Course overview
n What is discrete mathematics?
n Why is a math course part of the computer science
curriculum?
n Will I really ever use this stuff again?
n How to succeed in this course

What is discrete mathematics?
n Discrete mathematics is the study of distinct objects or
structures and their relationships to one another
n For example:
l How many ways can a valid password be chosen?
l Can traffic flow between two computers in a network?
l How can we transform messages to hide their contents?
l How do we parse a given sequence of commands?

n By contrast, continuous mathematics (e.g., calculus)
studies objects and relationships that vary continuously
l e.g., position, velocity, and acceleration of a projectile

Why study discrete math?
Reason 1: Computers do not process continuous data

Sampling and
discretization
Analog (continuous) input

Digital (discrete) output

Why study discrete math?
Reason 2: Computers aren’t actually all that smart, they are
just deterministic functions that map discrete
inputs to discrete outputs
Example: Does a given string contain an odd number of 1s?

Why study discrete math?
In general: Discrete mathematics allows us to better understand
computers and algorithms

function fib(int n)
if(n == 0 || n == 1)
return 1;
else
return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);

function fib(int n)
int first = 0;
int second = 1;
int tmp;
for(i = 1 to n)
tmp = first + second;
first = second;
second = tmp;
end for
return first;

Mastering discrete mathematics requires practice!

n Succeeding in this class requires practicing the skills
that we will acquire, thinking critically, and asking
questions
n Keys to success:
l Attend class and take notes
l Do your homework
l Work extra problems when you’re unsure
➣Solutions to odd-numbered exercises provided in textbook

l Go to your recitation every week
l Take advantage of office hours

Final thoughts
n Our goal is to prepare you to be stronger computer
scientists by:
l Exploring the formal underpinnings of computer science
l Developing critical thinking skills
l Articulating ties between theory and practice

n Next: Propositional logic
