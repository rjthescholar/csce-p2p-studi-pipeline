Lecture #2: Propositional Logic

Based on materials developed by Dr. Adam Lee

Today’s Topic: Propositional Logic
n What is a proposition?
n Logical connectives and truth tables
n Translating between English and propositional logic

Logic is the basis of all mathematical and analytical reasoning

Given a collection of known truths, logic allows us to
deduce new truths
Example
Base facts:
If it is raining, I will not go outside
If I am inside, Lisa will stay home
Lisa and I always play video games if we are together during the
weekend
Today is a rainy Saturday

Conclusion: Lisa and I will play video games today

Logic allows us to advance mathematics through an
iterative process of conjecture and proof

Propositional logic is a very simple logic

Definition: A proposition is a precise statement that is
either true or false, but not both.
Examples:
l 2 + 2 = 4 (true)
l All dogs have 3 legs (false)
l x2 < 0 (false)
l Washington, D.C. is the capital of the USA (true)

Not all statements are propositions

n Charlie is handsome
l “Handsome” is a subjective term.

n x3 < 0
l True if x < 0, false otherwise.

n Springfield is the capital
l True in Illinois, false in Massachusetts.

We can use logical connectives to build complex
propositions

We will discuss the following logical connectives:
l ¬ (not)
l Ù (conjunction / and)
l Ú (disjunction / or)
l Å (exclusive disjunction / xor)
l ® (implication)
l « (biconditional)

Negation
The negation of a proposition is true iff the proposition is
false
What we want
to know

What we know
One row for
each possible
value of “what
we know”

The truth table for negation
(I’ll sometimes use ⊤ and ⊥)

Negation Examples
Negate the following propositions
l Today is Monday
➣Today is not Monday

l 21 * 2 = 42
➣21 * 2 ¹ 42

What is the truth value of the following propositions
l ¬(9 is a prime number)
➣true

l ¬(Pittsburgh is in Pennsylvania)
➣false

Conjunction
The conjunction of two propositions is true iff both
propositions are true

The truth table for disjunction

Conjunction and disjunction examples
This symbol means “is defined as”
or “is equivalent to”
(sometimes I’ll use ≜)

Let:

l p º x2 ≥ 0
l q º A lion weighs less than a mouse
l r º 10 < 7
l s º Pittsburgh is located in Pennsylvania

What are the truth values of these expressions:
lpÙq
lpÙs
lpÚq
lqÚr

false
true
true
false

In-class Exercises
Problem 1: Let p º 2+2=5, q º eagles can fly, r º 1=1.
Determine the value for each of the following:
lpÙq
l ¬p Ú q
l p Ú (q Ù r)
l (p Ú q) Ù (¬r Ú ¬p)

Exclusive or (XOR)
The exclusive or of two propositions is true iff exactly one
proposition is true

The truth table for exclusive or
Note: Exclusive or is typically used to natural language to
identify choices. For example “You may have a soup or
salad with your entree.”

Implication
The implication p ® q is false if p is true and q is false,
and true otherwise
Terminology
l p is called the hypothesis
l q is called the conclusion

The truth table for implication

Implication (cont.)
The implication p ® q can be read in a number of
(equivalent) ways:
l If p then q
l p only if q
l p is sufficient for q
l q whenever p

Implication examples
Let:
l p º Jane gets a 100% on her final exam
l q º Jane gets an A on her final exam

What are the truth values of these implications:
lp®q
lq®p

true
false

Other conditional statements
Given an implication p ® q:
l q ® p is its converse
l ¬q ® ¬p is its contrapositive
l ¬p ® ¬q is its inverse

Why might this
be useful?

Note: An implication and its contrapositive always have
the same truth value

Biconditional
The biconditional p « q is true if and only if p and q assume the same
truth value

The truth table for the biconditional
Note: The biconditional statement p « q is often read as
“p if and only if q” or “p is a necessary and sufficient
condition for q.”

Truth tables can also be made for more complex expressions
Example: What is the truth table for (p Ù q) ® ¬r?

23 =

Like mathematical operators, logical operators
are assigned precedence levels
1. Negation
l

¬q Ú r means (¬q) Ú r, not ¬(q Ú r)

2. Conjunction
3. Disjunction
l

q Ù r Ú s means (q Ù r) Ú s, not q Ù (r Ú s)

4. Implication
l

q Ù r ® s means (q Ù r) ® s, not q Ù (r ® s)

5. Biconditional
In general, we will try to use parenthesis to
disambiguate these types of expressions.

In-class Exercises
Problem 2: Show that an implication p ® q and its
contrapositive ¬q ® ¬p always have the same value
l Hint: Construct two truth tables

Problem 3: Construct the truth table for the compound
proposition p Ù (¬q Ú r) ® s

English sentences can often be translated into propositional
sentences
But why would we do that?

Example #1

Example: You can see an R-rated movie only if you are
over 17 or you are accompanied by your legal guardian.
Let:

Find logical connectives

Translate fragments
l r º “You can see an R-rated movie”
l o º “You are over 17”
l a º “You are accompanied by your legal guardian”

Translation: r ® (o Ú a)
Create logical expression

Example #2

Example: You can have free coffee if you are senior
citizen and it is a Tuesday
Let:
c º “You can have free coffee”
n s º “You are a senior citizen”
n t º “It is a Tuesday”
n

Translation: (s Ù t) ® c

Example #3
Example: If you are under 17 and are not accompanied
by your legal guardian, then you cannot see the
R-rated movie.
Let:
n r º “You can see the R-rated movie”
n u º “You are under 17”
n a º “You are accompanied by your legal guardian”
Translation: (u Ù ¬a) ® ¬r
Note: The above translation is the contrapositive of the
translation from example 1!

Logic also helps us understand bitwise operations
n Computers represent data as sequences of bits
l e.g., 0101 1101 1010 1111

n Bitwise logical operations are often used to manipulate
these data
n If we treat 1 as true and 0 as false, our logic truth
tables tell us how to carry out bitwise logical operations

Bitwise logic examples
1010 1110
Ù 1110 1010
1010 1010

1110
Ú 1010
1110 1010
1110 1110

1110
Å 1010
1110 1010
0100 0100

In-class Exercises
Problem 4: Translate the following sentences
l If it is raining and today is Saturday then I will either play
video games or watch a movie
l You get a free salad only if you order off of the extended
menu and it is a Wednesday

Problem 5: Solve the following bitwise problems
1000
Å 1011
1010 0110

1000
Ù 1011
1010 0110
