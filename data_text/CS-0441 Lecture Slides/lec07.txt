Based on materials developed by Dr. Adam Lee

Today's topics
n Proof techniques
l How can I prove an implication is true?
l What forms can an informal proof take?

n Proof strategies
l Which proof techniques should I try?
l How do I find a proof without trying every proof technique?

Mathematical theorems are often stated in the
form of an implication
Example: If x > y, where x and y are positive real
numbers, then x2 > y2.
l ∀x,y [(x > 0) ∧ (y > 0) ∧ (x > y) → (x2 > y2)]
l ∀x,y P(x,y) → Q(x,y)

We will discuss three applicable proof methods:
l Direct proof
l Proof by contraposition
l Proof by contradiction

Direct proof
In a direct proof, we prove p → q by showing that if p is
true, then q must necessarily be true

Example: Prove that if n is an odd integer, then n2 is
an odd integer.

Proof:
l Assume that n is odd. That is n = (2k + 1) for some integer k.
l Note that n2 = (2k+1)2 = (4k2 + 4k + 1)
l We can factor the above to get 2(2k2 + 2k) + 1
l Since the above quantity is one more than even number, we
know that n2 is odd. ☐

Direct proofs are not always the easiest way to
prove a given conjecture.
In this case, we can try proof by contraposition
How does this work?
l Recall that p → q ≡ ¬q → ¬p
l Therefore, a proof of ¬q → ¬p is also a proof of p → q

Proof by contraposition is an indirect proof technique
since we don’t prove p → q directly.
Let’s take a look at an example…

Prove: If n is an integer and 3n + 2 is odd, then
n is odd.
First, attempt a direct proof:
l Assume that 3n + 2 is odd, thus 3n + 2 = 2k + 1 for some k
l Can solve to find that n = (2k – 1)/3
Where do we go from here?!?

Now, try proof by contraposition:
l Assume n is even, so n = 2k for some k
l 3(2k) + 2 = 6k + 2 = 2(3k + 1)
l So, 3n + 2 is also even.
l Since we proved ¬“n is odd” → ¬“3n+2 is odd”, we can
conclude that “3n + 2 is odd” → “n is odd” ☐

Proof by contradiction
Given a conditional p → q, the only way to reject this
claim is to prove that p ∧ ¬q is true.
In a proof by contradiction we:
1. Assume that p ∧ ¬q is true
2. Proceed with the proof
3. If this assumption leads us to a contradiction, we can
conclude that p → q is true

Let’s revisit an earlier example…

Prove: If n is an integer and 3n + 2 is odd, then
n is odd.
Proof:
l Assume the negation, that 3n + 2 is odd, n is even (i.e., n = 2k)
l 3n + 2 = 3(2k) + 2 = 6k + 2 = 2(3k + 1)
l The above statement tells us that 3n + 2 is even, which is a
contradiction of our assumption that 3n + 2 is odd.
l Therefore, we have shown that if 3n + 2 is odd, then n is also
odd. ☐

Note that the mechanics/algebra is the same! But the line
of argumentation is different
We can also use proof by contradiction in cases where
were the theorem to be proved is not of the form p → q

Prove: At least 10 of any 64 days fall on the
same day of the week
Proof:
l Let p ≡ “At least 10 of any 64 days fall on the same day of
the week”
l Assume ¬p is true, that is “At most 9 of any 64 days fall on
the same day of the week”
l Since there are 7 days in a week, at most 7× 9 = 63 days
can be chosen
l This is a contradiction of the fact that we chose 64 days
l Therefore, we can conclude that at least 10 of any 64 days
fall on the same day of the week. ☐

This proof is an example of the pigeonhole principle, which we will
study during our combinatorics unit.

In-class exercises
Problem 1: Prove the following claims
a) Use a direct proof to show that the square of an even
number is an even number.
b) Show that if m + n and n + p are even integers, then the
sum m + p is also an even integer.
c) Use proof by contraposition to show that if n is an integer
and n3 + 5 is odd, then n is even.

Sadly, not all theorems are of the form p → q
Sometimes, we need to prove a theorem of the form:
p1 ∨ p2 ∨ … ∨ pn → q

Note: p1 ∨ p2 ∨ … ∨ pn → q

Distributive law

≡ ¬(p1 ∨ p2 ∨ … ∨ pn) ∨ q
≡ (¬p1 ∧ ¬p2 ∧ … ∧ ¬pn) ∨ q
≡ (¬p1 ∨ q) ∧ (¬p2 ∨ q) ∧ … ∧ (¬pn ∨ q)
≡ (p1 → q) ∧ (p2 →q) ∧ … ∧ (pn → q)
So, we might need to examine multiple cases!

Prove that n2 + 1 ≥ 2n where n is a positive
integer with 1 ≤ n ≤ 4
Proof:
l n = 1: (1)2 + 1 = 2, 2(1) = 2, and 2 ≥ 2
l n = 2: (2)2 + 1 = 5, 2(2) = 4, and 5 ≥ 4
l n = 3: (3)2 + 1 = 10, 2(3) = 6, and 10 ≥ 6
l n = 4: (4)2 + 1 = 17, 2(4) = 8, and 17 ≥ 8

Since we have verified each case, we have shown that n2
+ 1 ≥ 2n where n is a positive integer with 1 ≤ n ≤ 4. ☐
With only 4 cases to consider, exhaustive proof was a good
choice!

Sometimes, exhaustive proof isn’t an option, but we
still need to examine multiple possibilities
Example: Prove the triangle inequality. That is, if x
and y are real numbers, then |x| + |y| ≥ |x + y|.
Clearly, we can’t use exhaustive proof here since
there are infinitely many real numbers to consider.
We also can’t use a simple direct proof either, since
our proof depends on the signs of x and y.

Example: Prove that if x and y are real numbers, then
|x| + |y| ≥ |x + y|.
n … on the board!

Making mistakes when using proof by cases is all
too easy!
Mistake 1: Proof by “a few cases” is not equivalent to
proof by cases.
This is a “there exists” proof,
not a “for all” proof!

Example: Prove that all odd numbers are prime.
“Proof:”
l Case (i): The number 1 is both odd and prime
l Case (ii): The number 3 is both odd and prime
l Case (iii): The number 5 is both odd and prime
l Case (iv): The number 7 is both odd and prime

Thus, we have shown that odd numbers are prime. ☐

Making mistakes when using proof by cases is all
too easy!
Mistake 2: Leaving out critical cases.
Example: Prove that x2 > 0 for all integers x
“Proof:”
l Case (i): Assume that x < 0. Since the product of two
negative numbers is always positive, x2 > 0.
l Case (ii): Assume that x > 0. Since the product of two
positive numbers is always positive, x2 > 0.

Since we have proven the claim for all cases, we can
conclude that x2 > 0 for all integers x. ☐
What about the case in which x = 0?

Sometimes we need to prove the existence of a
given element
There are two ways to do this
Prove the claim by showing how to construct
an example

The constructive approach
Show that it is guaranteed that such an
element exists

The non-constructive approach

A constructive existence proof
Prove: Show that there is a positive integer that can
be written as the sum of cubes of positive integers in
two different ways.

Proof: 1729 = 103 + 93 = 123 + 13 ☐
Obviously, the claim has been proven because we have
shown that a specific instance of the claim is valid.
Constructive existence proofs are really just instances of
“existential generalization.”

A non-constructive existence proof
Prove: Show that there exist two irrational numbers x
and y such that xy is rational.

Proof:
l We know that √2 is irrational, so let x = √2
l If √2√2 is rational, then we are done! (i.e., x = y = √2)
l If √2√2 is irrational, then let x = √2√2 and y = √2, both of which
are irrational
l Now, xy = (√2√2)√2 = √22 = 2, which is rational (i.e., 2 = 2/1) ☐

Note: We don’t know whether √2√2 is rational or
irrational. However, in either case, we can use it to
construct a rational number.

Sometimes, existence is not enough and we
need to prove uniqueness
This process has two steps:
1. Provide an existence proof
2. Show that any other solution to the problem is equivalent to
the solution generated in step 1

Example: Prove that if a and b are real numbers, then
there exists a unique real number r such that ar + b = 0
Existence

Proof:
l
l
l

Note that r = -b/a is a solution to this equality since
a(-b/a) + b = -b + b = 0.
Assume that as + b = 0, s ≠ r
Then as = -b, so s = -b/a = r, which is a contradiction

☐

Types of proof strategy
Today we’ll discuss four types of strategy:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Forward reasoning
Backward reasoning
Searching for counterexamples
Adapting existing proofs

Sometimes forward reasoning doesn’t work
In these cases, it is often helpful to reason backwards,
starting with the goal that we want to prove.

Example: Prove that given two distinct positive real
numbers x and y, the arithmetic mean of x and y is
always greater than the geometric mean of x and y.

(x + y)/2

√(xy)

Sanity check: Let x=8 and y=4. (8+4)/2 = 6. √(8×4) =
√(32) ≅ 5.66. 6 > 5.66

Prove that (x+y)/2 > √(xy) for all distinct pairs of
positive real numbers x and y.
Proof:
(x + y)/2 > √(xy)
(x + y)2/4 > xy
(x + y)2 > 4xy
x2 + 2xy + y2 > 4xy
x2 - 2xy + y2 > 0
(x – y)2 > 0
Since (x – y)2 > 0 whenever x ≠ y, the final inequality is
true. Since all of these inequalities are equivalent,
it follows that (x + y)/2 > √(xy). ☐

Other times, searching for a counterexample is helpful

Proof by counterexample is helpful if:
l Proof attempts repeatedly fail
l The conjecture to be proven looks “funny”

Example: Prove that every positive integer is the sum of
two squares.
This seems suspicious to me, since other factorizations
(e.g., prime factorizations) can be complex.

Counterexample:
3 is not the sum of two squares, so the claim is false. ☐

These four proof strategies are just a start!
A great tool for programmers AND logicians!

When trying to prove a new conjecture, a good “meta
strategy” is to:
1. If possible, try to reuse an existing proof (analogy!)
2. If the conjecture looks fishy, check for a counterexample
3. Attempt a “real” proof
a)
b)
c)

Apply the forward reasoning strategy
Or, apply the backward reasoning strategy
Possibly alternate between forward and backward reasoning

Unfortunately, not every proof can be solved using this
nice little meta strategy…
In fact, there are many, many proof strategies out there, and
NONE of them can be guaranteed to find a proof!!!

In-class exercises
Problem 2: Prove that there exists a positive integer
that is equal to the sum of all positive integers less
than it. Is your proof constructive or non-constructive?
Problem 3: Prove that there is no positive integer n
such that n2 + n3 = 100.
Problem 4: Use proof by cases to show that
min(a, min(b,c)) = min(min(a,b),c) whenever a, b, and
c are real numbers.
