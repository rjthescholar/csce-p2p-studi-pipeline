What is number theory?
Number theory is the branch of mathematics that
explores the integers and their properties.
Number theory has many applications within computer
science, including:
l Organizing data
l Encrypting sensitive data
l Developing error correcting codes
l Generating “random” numbers
l …

We will only scratch the surface…

The notion of divisibility is one of the most basic
properties of the integers
Definition: If a and b are integers and a ≠ 0, we say
that a divides b if there is an integer c such that b = ac.
We write a | b to say that a divides b, and a /| b to say
that a does not divide b.

Mathematically: a | b ⇔ ∃ c∈Z (b = ac)
Note: If a | b, then
la is called a factor of b
lb is called a multiple of a

We’ve been using the notion of divisibility all along!
lE = {x | x = 2k ∧ k ∈ Z}

Division examples
Examples:
l Does 4 | 16?
l Does 3 | 11?
l Does 7 | 42?

Yes, 16 = 4 × 4
No, because 11/3 is not an integer
Yes, 42 = 7 × 6

Question: Let n and d be two positive integers. How
many positive integers not exceeding n are divisible by
d?
Answer: We want to count the number of integers of the
form dk that are less than n. That is, we want to know
the number of integers k with 0 ≤ dk ≤ n, or 0 ≤ k ≤
n/d. Therefore, there are ⌊n/d⌋ positive integers not
exceeding n that are divisible by d.

Important properties of divisibility
Property 1: If a | b and a | c, then a | (b + c)

Property 2: If a | b, then a | bc for all integers c.

Property 3: If a | b and b | c, then a | c.

Division algorithm
Theorem: Let a be an integer and let d be a positive
integer. There are unique integers q and r, with
0 ≤ r < d, such that a = dq + r.

For historical reasons, the above theorem is called the
division algorithm, even though it isn’t an algorithm!

Terminology: Given a = dq + r
l a is called the dividend
l d is called the divisor
l q is called the quotient
l r is called the remainder
l q = a div d
l r = a mod d

div and mod are operators

Examples
Question: What are the quotient and remainder when 123 is
divided by 23?
Answer: We have that 123 = 23 × 5 + 8. So the quotient is 123
div 23 = 5, and the remainder is 123 mod 23 = 8.
Question: What are the quotient and remainder when -11 is
divided by 3?
Answer: Since -11 = 3 × -4 + 1, we have that the quotient is -4
and the remainder is 1.
Recall that since the remainder must be non-negative, 3 × -3 − 2
is not a valid use of the division theorem!

Many programming languages use the div and
mod operations
For example, in Java, C, and C++
l / corresponds to div when used on integer arguments
l % corresponds to mod

Prints out 1

public static void main(String[] args)
{
int x = 2;
Prints out 2, not 2.5!
int y = 5;
float z = 2.0;
System.out.println(y/x);
System.out.println(y%x);
System.out.println(y/z);

Prints out 2.5

}
This can be a source of many errors, so be careful in
your future classes!

Problem 3: Show that if 𝑎 is an integer and 𝑑 is an
integer greater than 1, then the quotient and remainder
!
!
obtained dividing 𝑎 by 𝑑 are " and 𝑎 − 𝑑 " ,
respectively.

Sometimes, we care only about the remainder of an
integer after it is divided by some other integer
Example: What time will it be 22 hours from now?

Answer: If it is 6am now, it will be (6 + 22) mod 24 =
28 mod 24 = 4 am in 22 hours.

Since remainders can be so important, they have
their own special notation!
Definition: If a and b are integers and m is a positive
integer, we say that a is congruent to b modulo m if
m | (a – b). We write this as a ≡ b (mod m).
Note: a ≡ b (mod m) iff a mod m = b mod m.

Examples:
l Is 17 congruent to 5 modulo 6?
l Is 24 congruent to 14 modulo 6?

Yes, since 6 | (17 – 5)
No, since 6 |
/ (24 – 14)

Properties of congruencies
Theorem: Let m be a positive integer. The integers a
and b are congruent modulo m (a ≡ b (mod m)) iff
there is an integer k such that a = b + km.

Theorem: Let m be a positive integer. If a ≡ b (mod
m) and c ≡ d (mod m), then
l (a + c) ≡ (b + d) (mod m)
l ac ≡ bd (mod m)

Congruencies have many applications within
computer science
Today we’ll look at three:
1. Hash functions
2. The generation of pseudorandom numbers
3. Cryptography

Hash functions allow us to quickly and
efficiently locate data
Problem: Given a large collection of records, how can we find the
one we want quickly?
Solution: Apply a hash function that determines the storage
location of the record based on the record’s ID. A common hash
function is h(k) = k mod n, where n is the number of available
storage locations.

Many areas of computer science rely on the ability to
generate pseudorandom numbers

Coding algorithms
Hardware, software, and
network simulation
Security

Network protocols

Congruencies can be used to generate
pseudorandom sequences
Step 1: Choose
l A modulus m
l A multiplier a
l An increment c
l A seed x0

Step 2: Apply the following
l xn+1 = (axn + c) mod m

Example: m = 9, a = 7, c = 4, x0 = 3
l x1 = 7x0 + 4 mod 9 = 7×3 + 4 mod 9 = 25 mod 9 = 7
l x2 = 7x1 + 4 mod 9 = 7×7 + 4 mod 9 = 53 mod 9 = 8
l x3 = 7x2 + 4 mod 9 = 7×8 + 4 mod 9 = 60 mod 9 = 6
l x4 = 7x3 + 4 mod 9 = 7×6 + 4 mod 9 = 46 mod 9 = 1
l x5 = 7x4 + 4 mod 9 = 7×1 + 4 mod 9 = 11 mod 9 = 2

The field of cryptography makes heavy use of
number theory and congruencies
Cryptography is the study of secret messages
Uses of cryptography:
l Protecting medical records
l Storing and transmitting military secrets
l Secure web browsing
l…

Congruencies are used in cryptosystems from antiquity, as
well as in modern-day algorithms
Since modern algorithms require quite a bit of background to
discuss, we’ll examine an ancient cryptosystem

The Caesar cipher is based on congruencies
To encode a message using the Caesar cipher:
l Choose a shift index s
l Convert each letter A-Z into a number 0-25
l Compute f(p) = p + s mod 26

Example: Let s = 9. Encode “ATTACK”.
l ATTACK = 0 19 19 0 2 10
l f(0) = 9, f(19) = 2, f(2) = 11, f(10) = 19
l Encrypted message: 9 2 2 9 11 19 = JCCJLT

Decryption involves using the inverse function
That is, f-1(p) = p - s mod 26

Example: Assume that s = 3. Decrypt the message
“UHWUHDW”.
l UHWUHDW = 20 7 22 20 7 3 22
l f-1(20) = 17, f-1(7) = 4, f-1(22) = 19, f-1(3) = 0
l Decrypted result: 17 4 19 17 4 0 19 = RETREAT
