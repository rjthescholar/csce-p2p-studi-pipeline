Lecture #13: Proof by Induction

Based on materials developed by Dr. Adam Lee

We’ve learned a lot of proof methods…
Basic proof methods
l Direct proof, contradiction, contraposition, cases, …

Proof of quantified statements
l Existential statements (i.e., ∃x P(x))
➣ Finding a single example suffices

l Universal statements (i.e., ∀x P(x)) can be harder to prove
➣

➣

Bottom line: We need new tools!

Mathematical induction lets us prove universally
quantified statements!
Goal: Prove ∀x∈N P(x).

Intuition: If P(0) is true, then P(1) is
true. If P(1) is true, then P(2) is
true…

Procedure:
1. Prove P(0)
2. Show that P(k) → P(k+1) for any arbitrary k
3. Conclude that P(x) is true ∀x∈N

P(0)
For arb. k, P(k) → P(k+1)
∴∀x∈N P(x)

Analogy: Climbing a ladder
Proving P(0):
l You can get on the first rung of the ladder

Proving P(k) → P(k+1):
l If you are on the kth step, you can get to
the (k+1)th step

∴ ∀x P(x)
l You can get to any step on the ladder

Analogy: Playing with dominoes
Proving P(0):
l The first domino falls

Proving P(k) → P(k+1):
l If the kth domino falls, then the
(k+1)th domino will fall

∴ ∀x P(x)
l All dominoes will fall!

All of your proofs should have the same overall
structure
P(x) ≡ Define the property that you are trying to prove
Base case: Prove the “first step onto the ladder.” Typically,
but not always, this means proving P(0) or P(1).

Inductive Hypothesis: Assume that P(k) is true for an arbitrary k
Inductive step: Show that P(k) → P(k + 1). That is, prove that once
you’re on one step, you can get to the next step. This
is where many proofs will differ from one another.

Conclusion: Since you’ve proven the base case and
P(k) → P(k + 1), the claim is true! ❏

I.H.: Assume that P(k) holds for an arbitrary integer k
Inductive step: We will now show that P(k) → P(k+1)
n 1+2+…+k = k(k+1)/2
n 1+2+…+k+(k+1) = k(k+1)/2 + (k+1)
n 1+2+…+k+(k+1) = k(k+1)/2 + 2(k+1)/2
n 1+2+…+k+(k+1) = (k2 + 3k + 2)/2
n 1+2+…+k+(k+1) = (k+1)(k+2)/2

Conclusion: Since we have proved the base case and the inductive
case, the claim holds by mathematical induction ❏

Induction cannot give us a formula to prove, but
can allow us to verify conjectures
Mathematical induction is not a tool for discovering new
theorems, but rather a powerful way to prove them

Example: Make a conjecture about the sum of the first n odd
positive numbers, then prove it.
l 1=1
l 1+3=4
l 1+3+5=9
l 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
l 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25

The sequence 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, … appears
to be the sequence {n2}

Conjecture: The sum of the first n odd positive integers is n2

Prove that the sum of the first n positive odd
integers is n2
P(n) ≡ The sum of the first n positive odd numbers is n2
Base case: P(1): 1 = 1

I.H.: Assume that P(k) holds for an arbitrary integer k
Inductive step: We will now show that P(k) → P(k+1)
n 1+3+…+(2k-1) = k2
n 1+3+…+(2k-1)+(2k+1) = k2+2k+1
n 1+3+…+(2k-1)+(2k+1) = (k+1)2

by I.H.
2k+1 to both sides
factoring

Note: The kth odd integer is 2k-1, the (k+1)th odd integer is
2k+1

Conclusion: Since we have proved the base case and the inductive
case, the claim holds by mathematical induction ❏

Prove that the sum 1 + 2 + 22 + … + 2n = 2n+1 - 1 for all
nonnegative integers n

I.H.: Assume that P(k) holds for an arbitrary integer k
Inductive step: We will now show that P(k) → P(k+1)
n 1+2+…+2k = 2k+1-1
n 1+2+…+2k+2k+1 = 2k+1-1+2k+1
n 1+2+…+2k+2k+1 = 2k+1+2k+1-1
n 1+2+…+2k+2k+1 = 2×2k+1-1
n 1+2+…+2k+2k+1 = 2k+2-1

by I.H.
2k+1 to both sides

Conclusion: Since we have proved the base case and the inductive
case, the claim holds by mathematical induction ❏

Why does mathematical induction work?
This follows from the well ordering axiom
l i.e., Every set of positive integers has a least element

We can prove that mathematical induction is valid using
a proof by contradiction.
l Assume that P(1) holds and P(k) → P(k+1), but ¬∀x P(x)
l This means that the set S = {x | ¬P(x)} is nonempty
l By well ordering, S has a least element m with ¬P(m)
l Since m is the least element of S, P(m-1) is true
l By P(k) → P(k+1), P(m-1) → P(m)
l Since we have P(m) ∧ ¬P(m) this is a contradiction!

Result: Mathematical induction is a valid proof method

Prove that 2n < n! for every positive integer n ≥ 4
Prelude: The expression n! is called the factorial of n.

Definition: n! = n × (n-1) × … × 3 × 2 × 1
Examples:

Note how quickly the factorial of
n “grows”

l 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24
l 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
l 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720
l 7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5,040
l 8! = 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 40,320

Base case: P(1): 3 | 0

✔

I.H.: Assume that P(k) holds for an arbitrary integer k
Inductive step: We will now show that P(k) → P(k+1)
n (k+1)3 – (k+1) = k3 + 3k2 + 3k + 1 – (k+1)
n
= k3 + 3k2 + 2k
n
= (k3 – k) + (3k2 + 3k)
n
= (k3 – k) + 3(k2 + k)
n Note that 3 | (k3 – k) by the I.H. and 3 | 3(k2 + k) by definition,
so 3 | [(k+1)3 – (k+1)]

I.H.: Assume that P(k) holds for an arbitrary integer k
Inductive step: We will now show that P(k) → P(k+1)
n Let S be a set of size k
n Assume without loss of generality that x ∉ S
n Let T = S ∪ {x}, so |T| = k+1
n ∀s⊆S (s ⊆ T) since T is a superset of S
n Furthermore, ∀s⊆S (s ∪ {x} ⊆ T) since x ∈ T
n Since S has 2k subsets by the I.H., T has 2×2k = 2k+1 subsets
Conclusion: Since we have proved the base case and the inductive
case, the claim holds by mathematical induction ❏
