A permutation is an ordered arrangement of a
set of objects
S=

σ(S) =

Note: A permutation of some set is essentially
just a shuffling of that set.

Sometimes we’re interested in counting the number of
ways that a given set can be arranged
Example: Suppose that a photographer wants to take a picture of
three dogs. How many ways can the dogs be arranged?

There are six possible
arrangements of three
dogs!

Counting permutations
In general, we can use the product rule to count the
number of permutations of a given set.
Given a set of n items, we have:
l n ways to pick the 1st item in the permuted set
l n-1 ways to pick the 2nd item in the permuted set
l n-2 ways to pick the 3rd item in the permuted set
l…
l 1 way to choose the last item in the permuted set

So, for a set of size n, we have n × (n-1) × (n-2) × … × 1
= n! ways to permute that set

And the winner is…
Example: Six friends run in a foot race. How many
possible outcomes of the race are there, assuming that
there are no ties?

Solution:
l 6 ways to choose 1st place
l 5 ways to choose 2nd place
l 4 ways to chose 3rd place
l 3 ways to choose 4th place
l 2 ways to choose 5th place
l 1 way to choose last place
l So there are 6! = 720 possible outcomes

Functions and permutations
Let S be some set. If f: S → S is a bijection, then f
describes a permutation of the set S.

Example: Let S = {1, 2, 3}, f(1) = 3, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 1

S=

1

2

3

f(S) =

3

2

1

More often than not, we’re only interested in
arranging a subset of a given set
Definition: An r-permutation is a permutation of some
r elements of a set.

Example: Let S = {Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave}. Then:
l Dave, Bob is a 2-permutation of S
l Carol, Alice, Bob is a 3-permutation of S
l Bob, Dave is a 2-permutation of S

Rather than specifying a particular r-permutation of a
set, we’re usually more interested in counting the
number of r-permutations of a set

Counting r-permutations
Definition: We denote the number of r-permutations of
a set of size n by P(n, r). By the product rule:

𝑛!
𝑃 𝑛, 𝑟 = 𝑛 × 𝑛 − 1 × … × 𝑛 − 𝑟 + 1 =
𝑛−𝑟 !

Example: In a foot race between six people, how many
ways can the gold, silver, and bronze medals be
assigned, assuming that there are no ties?

Solution:
l P(6, 3) = 6!/(6-3)! = 6!/3! = 720/6 = 120
l So, 120 ways to assign medals

The traveling salesperson
Example: A salesperson must visit 7 different cities.
The first and last cities of her route are specified by
her boss, but she can choose the order of the other
visits. How many possible trips can she take?

Solution:
l Since first and last cities are fixed,
we must count the number of ways
to permute the 5 remaining cities
l So, there are 5! = 120 possible trips
that the salesperson can take.

Counting strings
Example: How many permutations of “ABCDEFG”
contain the substring “ABC”?

Solution:
l Observation: Treat “ABC” as one character
l Now, how many ways are there to permute
{ABC, D, E, F, G}?
l |{ABC, D, E, F, G}| = 5
l 5! = 120 permutations contain the substring “ABC”

How do we count unordered selections of
objects?
Example: How many ways can we choose two objects
from the set S =

S1 =

=

S2 =

=

S3 =

=

Conclusion: There are three 2-combinations of a set
of size three.

Counting r-combinations
Definition: Let C(n, r) denote the number of rcombinations of a set of size n. Then:
𝑛!
𝐶 𝑛, 𝑟 =
𝑟! 𝑛 − 𝑟 !

Proof:
l

l
l
l
l
l

The r-permutations of the set can be formed by finding all
of the r-combinations of the set and then permuting each
r-combination in each possible way
There are 𝑃 𝑟, 𝑟 ways to permute each possible rcombination
So, 𝑃 𝑛, 𝑟 = 𝐶 𝑛, 𝑟 × 𝑃 𝑟, 𝑟
This means that 𝐶 𝑛, 𝑟 = 𝑃 𝑛, 𝑟 /𝑃 𝑟, 𝑟
= 𝑛!⁄ 𝑛 − 𝑟 ! ⁄𝑟!
= 𝑛!⁄ 𝑟! 𝑛 − 𝑟 ! ❏

Alternate notation
Note 1: Sometimes, C(n, r) is read “n choose r”

This is intuitive, as C(n, r) specifies the number of
ways to choose r objects from a set of size n.

Note 2: C(n, r) is often written as !" . In this class, I
will use the notation C(n, r) exclusively.

Be careful using the formula for C(n, r)
Using the formula for C(n, r) directly can result in
doing lots of multiplication…
Instead, note that much of the denominator cancels
out terms in the numerator. For example:

Poker Hands
Example: Given a standard 52-card deck, how many 5
card poker hands can be drawn?

Solution:
l C(52, 5) = 52!/[5! 47!]
l
= (52 × 51 × 50 × 49 × 48)/(5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1)
l
= 26 × 17 × 10 × 49 × 12
l
= 2,598,960 different hands

Choosing participants
Example: Say that a class consists of 30 students.
How many ways can 3 people be chosen from this class
to participate in a survey?

Solution:
l Want to compute is “30 choose 3”
l C(30, 3) = 30!/[3! 27!]
l
= (30 × 29 × 28)/(3 × 2)
l
= 10 × 29 × 14
l

= 4,060 ways to choose participants

An interesting observation…
Note: Given a set of size n, choosing r elements is the
same as excluding n-r elements.
This means that C(n, r) = C(n, n-r).

Proof:
l C(n, n-r) = n!/[(n-r)! (n-(n-r))!]
l
= n!/[(n-r)! r!]
l
= n!/[r! (n-r)!]
l
= C(n, r)

by simplification
by the commutative property
by definition ❏

Permutations and combinations can be used in
conjunction with the product and sum rules!
Example: Suppose the CS department has 11 faculty
members and the Math department has 9 faculty members.
How many ways can a committee consisting of 4 CS faculty
members and 3 Math faculty members be chosen?

Solution:
l C(11, 4) ways to choose 4 CS profs
l For each of these, there are C(9, 3) ways to choose 3 Math profs
l So, we need to compute C(11, 4) × C(9, 3)
l C(11, 4) × C(9, 3) = 11!/(4! 7!) × 9!/(3! 6!)
l
= 84 × 330
l

= 27,720 ways!

Combinations can be helpful when examining
binomial expressions
Definition: A binomial is an expression involving the sum of
two terms.
l For example (x + y) is a binomial, as is (3 + j)4.

r-Combinations are also called binomial coefficients, since
they occur as coefficients in the expansions of binomial
expressions.

Example:
(x + y)3 = x3 + 3x2y + 3xy2 + y3
= C(3,0)x3y0 + C(3,1)x2y1 + C(3,2)x1y2 + C(3,3)x0y3

The Binomial Theorem
The Binomial Theorem: Let x and y be variables, and
let n be a non-negative integer. Then:
!

𝑥 + 𝑦 ! = / 𝐶 𝑛, 𝑗 𝑥 !&# 𝑦 #
#$%

Example: Compute (x + y)2.
l C(2, 0) = 1
l C(2, 1) = 2
l C(2, 2) = 1
l (x + y)2 = x2y0 + 2x1y1 + x0y2
l
= x2 + 2xy + y2

A small example…
Question: What is the coefficient of x12y13 in the
expansion of (x+y)25?

Solution: By the binomial theorem, we know that this
term can be written as C(25,13)x12y13, so the
coefficient of x12y13 is C(25, 13) = 5,200,300.

A slightly more complicated example…
Question: What is the coefficient of x12y13 in the
expansion of (2x-3y)25?

Solution:
l Note that (2x-3y)25 = (2x + (-3)y)25
l The binomial theorem tells us that:
2𝑥 + −3𝑦

!"

!"

= 1 𝐶 25, 𝑗 2𝑥 !"&# −3𝑦 #
#$%

l Thus, the coefficient of x12y13 occurs when j = 13
l C(25,13)(2x)25-13(-3y)13 = C(25,13)212(-3)13x12y13
l So the coefficient = 25!/(13! 12!) 212 (-3)13
l
= -[25!/(13! 12!) 212 313]

Pascal’s Identity
Pascal’s identity: C(n+1, k) = C(n, k-1) + C(n, k)

Proof:
l Let T be a set of n+1 elements
l Let a ∈ T, and S = T — {a}
l By definition, there are C(n+1, k) subsets of T containing k
elements
l A subset of T containing k elements either contains k elements
of S, or the element a along with k-1 elements of S
l There are C(n, k) subsets of S containing k elements, so there
are C(n, k) subsets of T not containing a.
l Further, there are C(n, k-1) subsets of S containing k-1
elements, so there are C(n, k-1) subsets of T containing a.
l Thus, C(n+1, k) = C(n, k-1) + C(n, k) ❏

We can use Pascal’s identity to define C(n, r)
recursively
Basis step: For all n, we have that C(n, 0) = C(n, n) = 1
Recursive step: C(n+1, k) = C(n, k-1) + C(n, k)

Example: Compute C(3,2).
l C(3,2) = C(2,1) + C(2,2)
l
= C(1,0) + C(1,1) + 1
l
=1+1+1
l
=3
l
= 3!/(2!(3-2)!)

✔

Using this definition, we can compute
C(n, r) without using multiplication at
all!

set.
