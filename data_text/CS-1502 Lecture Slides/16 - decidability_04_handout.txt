The Set of Real Numbers is Uncountable
A real number R is a number with decimal representation
π = 3.14159265 . . .
345 = 345.000 . . .
1.23 = 1.23000 . . .

To show that a set R is not countable, we generally use proof
by contradiction
Assume that R is countable
R is countable, there is a correspondence between N and R
Since there is a correspondence between N and R, there are
infinitely many correspondence between N and R
This allows us to fill the right column of the correspondence
table any way we want (no duplicate):
n∈N

We need to find an element x ∈ R where f (n) 6= x for any

From the above table:
We choose the 1st digit after the decimal point of the real
number that corresponds with 1
We choose the 2nd digit after the decimal point of the real
number that corresponds with 2
We choose the 3rd digit after the decimal point of the real
number that corresponds with 3

Constructing x ∈ R starting from the first digit after the

The 3rd digit after the decimal point of f (3) is 3
The 4th digit after the decimal point of f (4) is 0
The 5th digit after the decimal point of f (4) is 0

Diagonalization

Let’s recap how we constructed x:
If the nth digit after the decimal point of f (n) is y, pick a
number that is not equal to y
We use that number (not equal to y) as the nth digit after the
decimal point of x

Claim: No n ∈ N such that f (n) = x
Because the nth digit after the decimal point of x will be
different that the nth digit after the decimal point of f (n)

The correspondence is not onto
Not a valid correspondence
R is uncountable

This method of constructing x is called diagonalization

Σ∗ is Countable
Let Σ = {0, 1}
How to show that Σ∗ is countable
We need to show a correspondence between N and Σ∗
Let’s list element of Σ∗ from the shortest one

f (n) ∈ Σ∗

strings will be on the right column
Thus, one-to-one and onto (a valid
correspondence)
Σ∗ is countable

Σ∗ is Countable
Another way is to explicitly define the function f : N → Σ∗
Not necessary
The table from the previous slide is good enough

Example, let Σ = {0, 1}
f (1) = ε
f (n) = binary representation of n − 2blog2 (n)c with length

Infinite Binary Sequence is Uncountable
Let B be a set of infinite binary sequence:
B = {x1 x2 . . . x∞ | xi = 0 or xi = 1}.
Show that B is uncountable
Again, we need to use proof by contradiction and
diagonalization:
Assume that B is countable
Thus, there exists a correspondence f : N → B
Since there is one, there are infinitely many correspondences
This is one of infinite many valid correspondences (based on
the assumption that B is countable):
n∈N
f (n) ∈ B

Diagonalization Example for Infinite Binary Sequence

When we construct x:
If the nth bit (from left) of f (n) is y, pick a number that is
not equal to y
If it is 0, pick 1
If it is 1, pick 0

We use that number as the nth bit (from left) of x

Claim: No n ∈ N such that f (n) = x
Because the nth digit bit (from left) of x will be different that
the nth bit (from left) of f (n)

The correspondence is not onto
Not a valid correspondence
The set of all infinite binary sequences (B) is uncountable

The Set of Turing Machines in Countable

Each Turing machine has its own encoding hM i
A string representation of TM M
A string is a finite sequence of symbols over a Σ

hM i for every machine has a finite length
Similar to Σ∗ , we can list all Turing machines in their
encoding form starting from the shortest length
Therefore, the set of Turing Machines is countable

Set of All Languages is Uncountable

Diagonalization works well when all elements are infinite
We need to pick the nth of something
The nth digit after the decimal point
The nth bit (from left)

If all elements are infinite long, it is guaranteed to have the nth
of something

But some languages are finite and some are infinite
Diagonalization does not work well for proving that the set of
all languages is uncountable

Same Size, Countable, and Uncountable

The following are what we have so far:
The set of all Turing machine is countable
The set of all infinite binary sequences is uncountable

We know that an uncountable set is larger than a countable
set
We need to show that the set of all languages has the same
size as the set of all infinite binary sequences
To show that two sets have the same size, we need to show a
correspondence
We need a correspondence between the set of all languages
and the set of all infinite binary sequences

The Set of All Languages is Uncountable
We can list the set of all strings over Σ = {0, 1} starting from
the shortest string as follows:
{ε, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, 001, . . . }
Given a language (either finite or infinite), we can also list the
language starting from the shortest string
The set of all strings that start with a 1
{1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, . . . }
The set of all strings of length 2
{00, 01, 10, 11}

Note that we use dictionary order for those with the same
length

Given a language, we can always list their strings to align with
strings in Σ∗

The Set of All Languages is Uncountable
When we align them as in previous slide, we can convert the
alignment into an infinite binary sequence XA :
Σ∗ = { ε, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, 001,
A ={
0,
00, 01,
000, 001,
XA =
0 1 0

XA is the infinite binary sequence that corresponds with the
language A
XA is a member of the set of all infinite binary sequences B

The above shows that for every language A, it corresponds to
XA ∈ B
The set of all languages has the same size as the set of all
infinite binary sequences
Since the set of all infinite binary sequences is uncountable,
the set of all languages is uncountable

Some Languages are not Turing-recognzable

Recall that
the set of all Turing machines is countable
the set of all languages is uncountable

The set of all languages is larger than the set of all Turing
machine
Note that one Turing machine only recognizes one language

Some languages are not Turing-recognizable.
