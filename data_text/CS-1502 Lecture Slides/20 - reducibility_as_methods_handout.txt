Language of a Turing Machine

The language of a Turing machine M denoted by L(M ) is the
set of all strings accepted by the Turing machine
Given a Turing machine M and a string w
If M accepts w, w ∈ L(M )
If M rejects w, w 6∈ L(M )
If M loops indefinitely on w, w 6∈ L(M )

Lets think about Turing machines as Java methods with the
following signature:
boolean method_name(String x)

Lets
true in Java means accept
false in Java means reject

Now, we can define the language of a method as the set of
all strings that the method returns true

Consider the following method
boolean M1(String x)
{
return true;
}

What is the language of the above method?
Obviously, M1() returns true no matter what argument of
type String you use
Thus, the language of the method M1() is Σ∗

The above method is pretty much the same as the Turing
machine below:
M1 = “On input x:
1

accept”

Note that L(M1 ) = Σ∗

Consider the following method
boolean M2(String x)
{
return false;
}

What is the language of the above method?
Obviously, M2() returns false no matter what argument of
type String you use
Thus, the language of the method M2() is ∅

The above method is pretty much the same as the Turing
machine below:
M2 = “On input x:
1

reject”

Note that L(M2 ) = ∅

Consider the following method
boolean M3(String x)
{
if(x.equals(""))
return true;
else
return false;
}

What is the language of the above method?
The above method only returns true if we call use the empty
string as the argument
For any other arguments that are not the empty string, it will
always return false
Thus, the language of the method M3() is {ε}

Suppose we have the method named is 0n1n with the
following signature:
boolean is_0n1n(String s)

This method returns true if the string s is in the form of 0n 1n
for any n ≥ 0
It returns false for any other strings
Examples:
is 0n1n("") is true
is 0n1n("0101") is false
is 0n1n("01") is true
is 0n1n("00111") is false
is 0n1n("000111") is true

Consider the following method
boolean M4(String x)
{
boolean p = is_0n1n(x);
if(p)
return true;
else
return false;
}

What is the language of the above method?
Obviously, M4() returns true for any argument of type
String of the form 0n 1n for any n ≥ 0
For any other strings, it will return false
Thus, the language of the method M4() is {0n 1n | n ≥ 0}

If x is in the form of 0n 1n , accept

Consider the following method
boolean M5(String x)
{
while(true);
return true;
}

What is the language of the above method?
Obviously, no matter what argument of type String you use
when call the above method, it will not return
It loops indefinitely on all arguments.
Thus, the language of the method M5() is ∅

The above method M5() is pretty much the same as the
Turing machine below:
M5 = “On input x:
1
2

Enter infinite loop
accept”

Note that L(M5 ) = ∅

Now suppose we have a method named M() and and a string
named w as follows:
boolean M(String s) {...}
String w = "...";

Note that we have no idea what is the method M()
It just a method that takes an argument of type String and
returns boolean
Just imagine that it can be any method with the above
signature
Can even thing of M as a reference variable that refers to a
method of the above signature

Obviously, w is a variable of type String.
What if we call M(w)?
We do not know whether it will return true, or false
It may not return at all (loops indefinitely)
We have no idea what are M and w

Consider the following method
boolean N1(String x)
{
boolean p = M(w);
if(p)
return true;
else
return false;
}

In this case, we have no idea about the language of the
method N1()
This is because have no idea what does M(w) return when
called
It may return true
It may return false
It may not return at all (M(w) loops indefinitely)

Suppose M(w) returns true, we can replace M(w) by true as
shown below:
boolean N1(String x)
{
boolean p = true;
if(p)
return true;
else
return false;
}

// Used to be boolean p = M(w);

Now, what is the language of the above method N1?
The language of the method N1 is Σ∗
This is under the assumption that M(w) returns true

So, here is what we can say about the method N1() so far:
If M(w) returns true, the language of N1() is Σ∗

// Used to be boolean p = M(w);

Suppose M(w) does not return at all
It loops indefinitely when called

Since N1() calls M(w) and M(w) loops indefinitely, N1() also
loops indefinitely.
In this case, we can insert the statement while(true); as
shown below
boolean N1(String x)
{
while(true);
boolean p = M(w);
if(p)
return true;
else
return false;
}

// Inserted to make N1 loops indefinitely

Now, what is the language of the above method N1?
Since N1() does not return true on any argument of type
String
The language of the method N1 is ∅

This is under the assumption that M(w) loops indefinitely

So, here is what we can say about the method N1() below:
boolean N1(String x)
{
boolean p = M(w);
if(p)
return true;
else
return false;
}

If M(w) returns true, the language of N1() is Σ∗
If M(w) returns false, the language of N1() is ∅
If M(w) loops indefinitely, the language of N1() is ∅

The behavior of the methods N1() depends on what happen
when M(w) is called
But again, we have no idea what are M() and w

Given a Turing machine M and a string w, the method N1()
is pretty much the same as the Turing machine below:
N1 = “On input x:
1
2

Run M on input w
If M accepts w, accept
If M rejects w, reject”

Similarly, we have no idea what is the language of N1 but at
least we know that
If M accepts w, L(N1 ) = Σ∗
If M rejects w, L(N1 ) = ∅
If M loops indefinitely on w, L(N1 ) = ∅

We can also conclude that
If M accepts w, the language of N1 is not empty
If M does not accept w, the language of N1 is empty
