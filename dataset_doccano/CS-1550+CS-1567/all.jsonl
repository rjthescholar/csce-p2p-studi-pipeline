associated with each process\n(also called task control block)\n• Process state – running, waiting, etc\n• Program counter – location of instruction to execute next\n• CPU registers – contents of all process-centric registers\n• CPU scheduling information- priorities, scheduling queue\npointers\n• Memory-management information – memory allocated to\nthe process\n• Accounting information – CPU used, clock time elapsed\nsince start, time limits\n• I\/O status information – I\/O devices allocated to process,\nlist of open files\nCS\/COE 1550 – Operating Systems – Sherif

system\nmust save the state of the old process and load the\nsaved state for the new process via a context\nswitch\n• Context of a process represented in the PCB\n• Context-switch time is overhead; the system does no\nuseful work while switching\n• The more complex the OS and the PCB ➔ the longer the\ncontext switch\n\n• Time dependent on hardware support\n• Some hardware provides multiple sets of registers per\nCPU ➔ multiple contexts loaded at once\nCS\/COE 1550 – Operating Systems – Sherif Khattab\n\n11\n\n\fContext Switching\n\nCS\/COE 1550 – Operating Systems – Sherif

hardware methods\n• Test & set: test a variable and set it in one instruction\n• Atomic swap: switch register & memory in one instruction\n• Turn off interrupts: process won’t be switched out unless it\nasks to be suspended\n\n• The first two methods can be implemented in user\nland\n• Why can’t we implement the third method in user land?\n\nCS\/COE 1550 – Operating Systems – Sherif

Is this the system\nsoftware engineers' job to ensure every process will invoke wait( )\ndefaultly to avoid creating zombie processes, or is OS's job and it\ncan arbitrarily invoke wait( ) or not?\n\n•\n\ndoes a process actually wait when wait() is called? like stops\nrunning\n\n•\n\nZombie vs Orphan processes\n\n•\n\nWhat are the differences of a zombie and orphan process?

Are there any ways of reducing the time\nspent doing these checks\n\n•\n\ncan we run the banker's algorithm or some alternative as a static analysis tool? like build this kind of\ncheck into the compiler or something instead of running it for each request during runtime\n\n•\n\nIf a state is determined unsafe, does that always mean that the resource will not be allocated or is it\npossible to still allocate it and take the risk\n\n•\n\nWhat does the E, P and A stand for in the bankers algorithm\n\n•\n\nif bankers algorithm finds a valid path and grants the resource, can a deadlock still occur if a different\npath is followed than the one bankers algorithm found?\n\n•\n\nI'm a little confused on what the want and hold tables represent\n\n•\n\nWhy is the runtime n^2 * n for the wait algorithm\n\n•\n\nWhat is the difference between wanted and max again?\n\n•\n\nTracing bankers algorithms with multiple resource instances\n\nCS\/COE 1550 – Operating Systems – Sherif Khattab\n\n4\n\n\fMuddiest Points (Resource Trajectory)\n• the l1, l2 l3 ... in the resource trajectory graph\n\n• resource trajectory graphs with more than 2 resources\n• How to prevent a resource trajectory that would cause a\ndeadlock\n\nCS\/COE 1550 – Operating Systems – Sherif Khattab\n\n5\n\n\fMuddiest Points (General Deadlock)\n• breaking circular wait seems almost always better than breaking\nhold and wait since breaking hold and wait requires you take all\nresources you need whereas breaking circular wait only makes you\ntake some extra resources before you need them\n• Starvation vs deadlock\n• Which detection alg is fastest?\n• Where do deadlock detection algorithms exist? (Operating system\nor external application.) When do they run? Runtime or compile\ntime? Also, how do deadlock avoidance algorithms interfere to\nmake sure a program doesn’t deadlock?

tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu\n\nLaunch File\n\n\fMultiple Processes for One Application\nRecall that you may have to open multiple console and\nexecute multiple commands just to run one robot application\nExample: Project 2\nTerminal 1: ROS Master\nroscore\n\nTerminal 2: Kobuki Node\nroslaunch kobuki_node minimal.launch\n\nTerminal 3: gscam Node\nroslaunch gscam v4l.launch\n\nTerminal 4: cmvision Node\nroslaunch mypackage cmvision.launch\n\nTerminal 5: Constant command\nrosrun mypackage constant_command.py\n\nTerminal 6: Control node for project 2\nrosrun mypackage project2.py\nThumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu\n\nLaunch File\n\n\fMultiple Processes for One Application\n\nROS allows you to execute one single command which results\nin executing multiple processes\nYou need a launch file\nIn ROS, a launch file is a text file with XML style (tags) with\nthe extension .launch\nTraditionally located in the launch directory under your\npackage\n\/home\/student\/cs1567\/src\/mypackage\/launch\n\nBut it can be located anywhere under your package\n(mypackage) directory\n\nThumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu\n\nLaunch File\n\n\fThe <launch> Tag\n\nAll content of the launch file must be surrounded by the\n<launch> tag:\n<launch>\n<!-- This is a comment -->\n\n<\/launch>\n\nA comment must be surrounded by <!-- and --> as shown\nabove\n\nThumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu\n\nLaunch File\n\n\fThe <include> Tag\n\nTo let the launch file execute another launch file, use the\n<include> tag\n<launch>\n:\n<!-- roslaunch kobuki_node minimal.launch -->\n<include file=\"$(find kobuki_node)\/launch\/minimal.launch\"\/>\n:\n<\/launch>\n\nThe $(find kobuki node) will result in the path to the\nlocation of the kobuki node package\nIn case of the kobuki node package, the launch file is located\nunder the launch directory\n\nThumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu\n\nLaunch File\n\n\fThe <include> Tag\nFor other packages, simply navigate to the package’s directory\nusing roscd and look for it\nFor example, gscam:\nstudent@robot:\/home\/student$ roscd gscam\nstudent@robot:\/opt\/ros\/kinetic\/share\/gscam$ ls\ncmake\ngscam_nodeletlaunch\nnodelet_plugins.xml\nexamples nodelet_pipeline.launch package.xml\n\nv4l.launch\n\nNote that launch files of gscam package are not in the\nlaunch directory\nThus, for the gscam node:\n<launch>\n:\n<!-- roslaunch gscam v4l.launch -->\n<include file=\"$(find gscam)\/v4l.launch\"\/>\n:\n<\/launch>\n\nThumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu\n\nLaunch File\n\n\fThe <node> Tag\nTo let the launch file execute a node, use the <node> tag\n<launch>\n:\n<!-- rosrun mypackage constant_command.py -->\n<node name=\"constant_command\" pkg=\"mypackage\"\ntype=\"constant_command.py\"\/>\n:\n<\/launch>\n\nThe name indicates the name of the node\nIn most case, it should be the same as the in\nrospy.init node()\nDifferent name will overwrite the node name when it is\ninitialized\n\nThe pkg indicates the name of the package\nThe type indicates the name of the executable file\n\nThumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu\n\nLaunch File\n\n\fThe <node> Tag\nLet’s put them all together for project 2 (p2.launch)\n<launch>\n<!-- roslaunch kobuki_node

type=\"constant_command.py\"\/>\n<!-- rosrun mypackage project2.py -->\n<node name=\"project2\" pkg=\"mypackage\" type=\"project2.py\" output=\"screen\" cwd=\"node\"\/>\n<\/launch>\n\nNotes:\nIf your node needs to show output on the console screen, you\nneed to add output=\"screen\" as shown above\nThe cwd=\"node\" specifies the working directory to be the\nlocation of the executable

command\nIf the roscore is not currently running, the launch file will\nalso execute the roscore command\n\nYou only need one console screen\nIf all your nodes support Ctrl-C, by pressing Ctrl-C, it
