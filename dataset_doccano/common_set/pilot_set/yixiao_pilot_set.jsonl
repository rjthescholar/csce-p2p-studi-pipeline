(makes sense!!)\n\n• The Operating System defines what a process and its abstraction is.\n▪ There is an OS representation and metadata associated with a process.\n▪ The OS maintains two key lies:\n\n• The control flow (exclusive use of CPU): as defined by the code (this lecture)\n• The memory layout (exclusive use of memory): defined by executable\/code (next lecture)\n\n• We are focusing on the control flow, here.\n\n▪ How do we determine when a program runs? When does the lie… break down?\n6\n\n\fCPU Scheduling\nEeny Meeny Miney Moe\n\n7\n\n\fThe Reality\n• Let us say that we have a machine with four separate CPUs.\n▪ You could run four processes concurrently (at the same time) relatively easily.\n▪ What about the fifth?\nstack\n\nstack\n\nstack\n\nstack\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\nCPU State:\nRegisters\n,\n\n8\n\n\fMultiplexing the CPU\n• Truth be told, we often have fewer resources than needed.\n▪ Sharing a common resource is called multiplexing.\n\n• Now, consider a machine with a single CPU.\n\nProcess\n\nstack\n.bss\n\n• We often want to run something in the foreground.\n\n▪ Word processor, web browser, minesweeper… whatever.\n\n.data\n\n• We still want some things running the background…\n\n.text\n\n• We need to switch from one process to another at\nparticular times.\n\nCPU State:\nRegisters\n,\n\n▪ Music player, virus scanner, chat client.\n\n▪ Yet… we have to keep the illusion that the program is\nuninterrupted…\n\nCPU\n\n9\n\n\fNaïve Campbell was great in The Craft (1996)\n• One way is to run processes sequentially (the naïve solution)\n▪ When one process ends… run the next.\n▪ Yet that’s not very flexible.

Called preemptive scheduling.\n▪ Processes give up control when hardware interjects via an “interrupt”\n▪ How does this work?\n\n14\n\n\fRound Robin Scheduling\n• One method is to just cycle through each process each for equal time.\n▪ This is an element of “fairness” … each gets equal stake.\n50ms\n\n50ms\n\n50ms\n\n50ms\n\nstack\n\nstack\n\nstack\n\nstack\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\nCPU State A:\nRegisters\n,\n\nCPU State B:\nRegisters\n,\n\nCPU State C:\nRegisters\n,\n\nCPU State D:\nRegisters\n,\n\nMemory\nCPU\n\n15\n\n\fProblems with “fairness”\n• Let’s say I want to play Doom Eternal\n▪ In round-robin, I give the video game 25% of my resources.\n50ms\n\n50ms\n\n50ms\n\n50ms\n\nstack\n\nstack\n\nstack\n\nstack\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\nCPU State A:\nRegisters\n,\n\nCPU State B:\nRegisters\n,\n\nCPU State C:\nRegisters\n,\n\nCPU State D:\nRegisters\n,\n\nThis should get\nmore priority.\n\nCPU\n\n16\n\n\fI have priorities!\n• Round-Robin schedulers are fair; then we tweak to meet expectations.\n▪ How might we add a sense of “priority” to the scheduler?\n\n• Let’s look at a visualization of how processes are currently scheduled\nwith a round-robin scheme: (Doom gets only 25% of resources!) \n50ms\n\n50ms\n\n50ms\n\n50ms\n\n50ms\n\n50ms\n\nA\n\nA\nB\n\nB\n\nC\n50ms \/ 200ms = 25%\n\n17\n\n\fI have priorities!\n• Round-Robin schedulers are fair; then we tweak to meet expectations.\n▪ How might we add a sense of “priority” to the scheduler?\n\n• We could give some tasks a longer quantum.\n▪ A quantum is the amount of time a task is guaranteed to run.\n100ms\n\n50ms\n\n50ms\n\n50ms\n\n100ms\n\nA\nB\n\nC\n100ms \/ 250ms = 40%\n\n18\n\n\fI have priorities!\n• Round-Robin schedulers are fair; then we tweak to meet expectations.\n▪ How might we add a sense of “priority” to the scheduler?\n\n• We could increase the chance a specific task is scheduled.\n▪ Round-robin + priority: two queues, switch back and forth and round-robin\nwithin them.\n50ms\n\n50ms\n\n50ms\n\n50ms\n\n50ms\n\n50ms\n\nA\nB\n\nC\n100ms \/ 200ms = 50%\n\n19\n\n\fI have priorities!\n• Round-Robin schedulers are fair; then we tweak to meet expectations.\n▪ How might we add a sense of “priority” to the scheduler?\n\n• We can then always do some sort of combination.\n▪ Hybrid approaches do seem very alluring.

What luck!\n\n• However: You do not know when that button will be pressed.\n▪ Maybe it is a sensor, like for detecting a fire!\n• FIRE SEEMS IMPORTANT!! … and yet.\n\n• Moral of the story: humans being users make things very hard.\n\n22\n\n\fAgain, it is not magic.\n• But… wait… how does hardware stop a program?\n▪ For instance, when the quantum is up, how does the OS get control and\nperform the context switch?\n\n• Ah, the hardware has support for “being rude” which is called an\ninterrupt.\n▪ A programmable mechanism for asynchronously calling a function when a\nparticular type of error or signal is noticed.\n\n• Let’s take a look.\n\n23\n\n\fInterrupts\nIt’s rude… but necessary.\n\n24\n\n\fHow rude\n• An interrupt is an exceptional state that diverts execution from its\nnormal flow.\n▪ When issued by hardware, sometimes referred to as a hardware exception\n• For instance, a hardware timer or external event caused by a sensor.\n\n▪ When caused by a user process, sometimes referred to as a software trap\n• Divide-by-zero error, some floating-point exceptions, system calls.\n\n• We have seen these before!\n▪ System calls are a type of interrupt (software trap).\n▪ This is an intentional interrupt caused by a specific program instruction.\n• The program is “interrupted” while the OS performs a task.\n\n• We have also encountered them in our failures.\n▪ Segmentation \/ Protection \/ Page Faults are also interrupts. (trap? exception?)\n▪ These are (usually) unintentional interrupts caused by a generic instruction. 25\n\n\fHere are some typical UNIX\/Linux system calls:\nNumber\n\nName\n\nDescription\n\nread\n\nReads bytes from an open file.\n\nwrite\n\nWrites bytes to an open file.\n\nopen\n\nOpens a file and returns the file handle.\n\nclose\n\nCloses an open file.\n\nstat\n\nReturns metadata about a file.\n\nfork\n\nSpawns a copy of the current process.\n\nexecve\n\nLoads and then executes a program.\n\n26\n\n\fSystem calls\n• System calls: predictable, intentional interrupts at specific instructions.\n▪ Interrupts occurring at specific instructions are synchronous interrupts.\n\n• In x86-64, the program pauses at a\ninstruction, then resumes\nat the following instruction when the OS finishes the task\n▪ (… and the OS calls the\n\ninstruction)\n\n• Let’s take a deeper look.\n27\n\n\fHello, Hello World\nx86-64 (gas \/ AT&T syntax) - Application\n\nx86-64 (gas \/ AT&T syntax) - Kernel (main OS program)\n\nPre-registered to be called on syscall\nSaves CPU state\n\nA jump to the kernel\n\nPerforms action\nRestores state\n\nReturns to process\n\n28\n\n\fTick tock tick tock merrily sings the clock\n• A hardware timer can preempt (forcibly pause) a program at any time.\n▪ Interrupts that occur at any instruction are asynchronous interrupts.\n\n• In a preemptive operating system, a hardware timer is used to give a\nmaximum bound to how long a process runs.\n▪ Your operating system programs the timer such that it sends a signal at a\nregular interval.\n▪ Your operating system has a function that is called when such a signal is read.\n▪ That function will respond by invoking the scheduler and pausing the current\ntask and resuming or starting another.\n\n• Let’s look at the basic procedure an OS uses to program an interrupt.\n29\n\n\fProgramming interruption\n• On most hardware, there is a programmable table somewhere in\nmemory that, when written to, defines where code exist to handle\neach interrupt.\n• Every possible interrupt is given a number. Segmentation faults might\nbe interrupt 10. Timers might be interrupt 0. Et cetera.\n• When an interrupt occurs, based on its interrupt number, the\ncorresponding entry in a lookup table called an interrupt vector table\nor an interrupt descriptor table would be used to determine where in\nthe kernel to jump.\n30\n\n\fThe Interrupt Table\n#\n\nValue\n\n• The interrupt table is a simple table.\n\nDescription\nDivide by zero\n\n• Fun Fact: It is often located at\naddress 0x0 in memory!\n\nOverflow\nDouble Fault\nGeneral Protection Fault\nPage Fault\nStack Fault\nAlignment Error\n...\nTimer Signal\nNetwork Device Signal\n\n▪ So, operating system kernels can’t\nexactly always treat zero as an invalid\naddress…\n\n• When a process triggers a listed\ninterrupt or external hardware sends\na signal to the interrupt controller…\n▪ the CPU jumps to the given address.\n\nAudio Device Signal\n\n31\n\n\fAh! There art thee ol’ interrupt!\n• Let’s take a look at interrupt handling…\nx86-64 (gas \/ AT&T syntax) – Process B\nA\n\nContext (A)\n\nCPU State\n\nx86-64 (gas \/ AT&T syntax) – Kernel\n\n• An interrupt is the likely\ncause of our prior\ninterruption.\n• The interrupt handler is the\ncode that handles context\nswitching and scheduling\n32\n\n\fOverview\n• Interrupts can be categorized in several ways:\n▪ They can occur outside of our program:\nhardware exceptions\n▪ They can occur on an instruction in our program: software trap\n▪ They can occur at any time:\nasynchronous interrupts\n▪ They can occur at specific times:\nsynchronous interrupts\n\n• Interrupts are what allow operating systems to function!\n▪ When you press a key on your keyboard.\n▪ When you receive a packet on the network.\n▪ When your sound card wants the next second of audio.\n▪ When you divide by zero…\n• To then mercilessly murder your
