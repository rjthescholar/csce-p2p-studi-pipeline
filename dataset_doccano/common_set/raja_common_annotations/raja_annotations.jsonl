It\nneeds to be used in context.\n• There are two main relationships\nbetween classes\n– Sub\/Super class\n– Ownership\n\n\fSubclasses\n• A subclass of a class is a more specific\ntype of a class\n• Also known as the child of a class\n• For example, a tree would be a subclass\nof plant\n• Subclasses are meant to expand upon\nthe behavior of their more general\nparent class\n• You can have several subclasses\n\n\fSuperclasses\n• On the converse, a superclass is a more\nabstract and general version of a class\n• Also known as the parent of a class\n• Plant is the superclass of Tree\n• You can only have one superclass\n\n\fDeclaring a Class to be a\nSubtype\n• In order to declare a class’s parent, use\nthe keyword extends\n• (Classes that do not have a parent class\nimplicitly extend the Object class)\n\n\fInheritance\n• A subclass inherits all non-private fields\nand methods\n• Accessing these fields and methods\nrequires the keyword super.\n• (Note: you may also be able to access\nprivate fields with the parent class’s\ngetters and setters, which may be safer)\n\n\fRestricting Access\n• What if you want a field or method to be\ninherited, but still do not necessarily\nwant it to be accessed by anyone?\n• Use the keyword protected\n• Remember, releasing your access to\nthese fields and methods should only\nbe done when necessary\n\n\fRegarding Constructors\n• Constructors cannot be inherited, even\nthough they are public\n• However, you can, and should, use them\nfrom the subclass’s constructor, to\nensure complete initialization\n• You can call the parent’s constructor by\nusing the keyword super\n\n\fCalling Superclass Constructor\n• Unlike calling an overloaded\nconstructor of the same class, calling a\nsuperclass constructor does not need to\nbe the only line of code\n• However, it must still be the first line of\ncode in the constructor\n\n\fExample\npublic class Vehicle\n{\nprivate final int numWheels;\n…\npublic Vehicle(int numWheels)\n{\nthis.numWheels = numWheels;\n…\n}\/\/end function(double)\n…\n}\/\/End class Vehicle\n\n\fExample\npublic class Car extends Vehicle\n{\nprivate int numPassengers;\nprivate double gasRemaining;\n…\npublic Car(int numPassengers, double gasRemaining)\n{\nsuper(4);\nthis.numPassengers = numPassengers;\nthis.gasRemaining = gasRemaining;\n}\/\/end constructor(int,double)\n…\n}\/\/End class Plant\n\n\fWhat If the Superclass’s Method\nDefinition Does Not Fit the Class’s?\n• We can override the definition by using\nthe exact same function header\n• The line directly above function header\nmust have “@Override” only\n• As an example, our Car class should\nprobably use the original “move”\nmethod, rather than creating an entirely\nnew “drive” method that does\nsomething similar\n\n\fOverride\npublic class Car extends Vehicle\n{\nprivate int numPassengers;\nprivate double gasRemaining;\n…\n@Override\npublic boolean move(double dist)\n{\nreturn super.move(dist*10.0) &&\n(this.gasRemaining > 0);\n}\/\/end function(double)\n…\n}\/\/End class Plant\n\n\fOverriding\n• I can still reference the original method\nusing the super keyword\n• Unless your overridden method totally\ndiscards the functionality of the\nsuperclass’s method, you should call the\nsuperclass’s method at least once\n\n\fNote\n• You cannot override constructors\n\n\fOwnership\n• Ownership is simply one class using\nanother as a property\n• A Car may have an Engine, a Radio, and\nan Owner, depending on what you need\n• A Car’s superclass and subclasses\ncertainly are not Engine, Radio, and\nOwner\n\n\fUsing the Classes\npublic class Garage\n{\nprivate Vehicle[] vehicles;\n…\npublic Garage(int capacity)\n{\nthis.vehicles = new Vehicle[capacity];\nfor(int i = 0; i < vehicles.length; i++)\n{\nvehicles[i] = null;\n}\n…\n}\/\/end constructor(int)\n…\n}\/\/End class Garage\n\n\fUsing the Classes\npublic class Garage\n{\n…\npublic boolean addVehicle(Vehicle vehicle)\n{\n\/\/Note: there is a better way!\nfor(int i = 0; i < vehicles.length; i++)\n{\nif(vehicles[i] == null)\n{\nvehicles[i] = vehicle;\nreturn true;\n}\n}\nreturn false;\n}\/\/end method(Vehicle)\n}\/\/End class Garage\n\n\fQUESTIONS?\n\n\fModeling a Problem\n“Joe’s Automotive Shop services foreign cars, and\nspecializes in servicing cars made by Mercedes,\nPorsche, and BMW.

(makes sense!!)\n\n• The Operating System defines what a process and its abstraction is.\n▪ There is an OS representation and metadata associated with a process.\n▪ The OS maintains two key lies:\n\n• The control flow (exclusive use of CPU): as defined by the code (this lecture)\n• The memory layout (exclusive use of memory): defined by executable\/code (next lecture)\n\n• We are focusing on the control flow, here.\n\n▪ How do we determine when a program runs? When does the lie… break down?\n6\n\n\fCPU Scheduling\nEeny Meeny Miney Moe\n\n7\n\n\fThe Reality\n• Let us say that we have a machine with four separate CPUs.\n▪ You could run four processes concurrently (at the same time) relatively easily.\n▪ What about the fifth?\nstack\n\nstack\n\nstack\n\nstack\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\nCPU State:\nRegisters\n,\n\n8\n\n\fMultiplexing the CPU\n• Truth be told, we often have fewer resources than needed.\n▪ Sharing a common resource is called multiplexing.\n\n• Now, consider a machine with a single CPU.\n\nProcess\n\nstack\n.bss\n\n• We often want to run something in the foreground.\n\n▪ Word processor, web browser, minesweeper… whatever.\n\n.data\n\n• We still want some things running the background…\n\n.text\n\n• We need to switch from one process to another at\nparticular times.\n\nCPU State:\nRegisters\n,\n\n▪ Music player, virus scanner, chat client.\n\n▪ Yet… we have to keep the illusion that the program is\nuninterrupted…\n\nCPU\n\n9\n\n\fNaïve Campbell was great in The Craft (1996)\n• One way is to run processes sequentially (the naïve solution)\n▪ When one process ends… run the next.\n▪ Yet that’s not very flexible. (Stop your music player to open a PDF)\n• Humans are in the mix! We need computers to be useful to us.\n\nstack\n\nstack\n\nstack\n\nstack\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\nMemory\nCPU\n\n10\n\n\fThe cruel passage of time\n• To multiplex the CPU, we quickly switch from process to process.\n• The OS retains\/restores the state (context) of the process.\n▪ The OS must store this as a form of process metadata in memory.\nstack\n\nstack\n\nstack\n\nstack\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\nCPU State A:\nRegisters\n,\n\nCPU State B:\nRegisters\n,\n\nCPU State C:\nRegisters\n,\n\nCPU State D:\nRegisters\n,\n\nMemory\nCPU\n\n11\n\n\fThe Context Switch\n• When an Operating System goes from\none process to another, it performs a\ncontext switch.\n• This swaps out the CPU state of one\nprocess for the next one to run.\n1. Store registers (including stack\npointer and program counter) to\nmemory.\n2. Determine next process to run.\n3. Load those registers from memory.\nSwitch memory space. (see next lecture:\n\nstack\n\nstack\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\n.bss\n.data\n.text\n\nContext\n\nContext\n\nCPU State A:\nRegisters\n,\n\nCPU State B:\nRegisters\n,\n\nvirtual memory)\n\n4.

What luck!\n\n• However: You do not know when that button will be pressed.\n▪ Maybe it is a sensor, like for detecting a fire!\n• FIRE SEEMS IMPORTANT!! … and yet.\n\n• Moral of the story: humans being users make things very hard.\n\n22\n\n\fAgain, it is not magic.\n• But… wait… how does hardware stop a program?\n▪ For instance, when the quantum is up, how does the OS get control and\nperform the context switch?\n\n• Ah, the hardware has support for “being rude” which is called an\ninterrupt.\n▪ A programmable mechanism for asynchronously calling a function when a\nparticular type of error or signal is noticed.\n\n• Let’s take a look.\n\n23\n\n\fInterrupts\nIt’s rude… but necessary.\n\n24\n\n\fHow rude\n• An interrupt is an exceptional state that diverts execution from its\nnormal flow.\n▪ When issued by hardware, sometimes referred to as a hardware exception\n• For instance, a hardware timer or external event caused by a sensor.\n\n▪ When caused by a user process, sometimes referred to as a software trap\n• Divide-by-zero error, some floating-point exceptions, system calls.\n\n• We have seen these before!\n▪ System calls are a type of interrupt (software trap).\n▪ This is an intentional interrupt caused by a specific program instruction.\n• The program is “interrupted” while the OS performs a task.\n\n• We have also encountered them in our failures.\n▪ Segmentation \/ Protection \/ Page Faults are also interrupts. (trap? exception?)\n▪ These are (usually) unintentional interrupts caused by a generic instruction. 25\n\n\fHere are some typical UNIX\/Linux system calls:\nNumber\n\nName\n\nDescription\n\nread\n\nReads bytes from an open file.\n\nwrite\n\nWrites bytes to an open file.\n\nopen\n\nOpens a file and returns the file handle.\n\nclose\n\nCloses an open file.\n\nstat\n\nReturns metadata about a file.\n\nfork\n\nSpawns a copy of the current process.\n\nexecve\n\nLoads and then executes a program.\n\n26\n\n\fSystem calls\n• System calls: predictable, intentional interrupts at specific instructions.\n▪ Interrupts occurring at specific instructions are synchronous interrupts.\n\n• In x86-64, the program pauses at a\ninstruction, then resumes\nat the following instruction when the OS finishes the task\n▪ (… and the OS calls the\n\ninstruction)\n\n• Let’s take a deeper look.\n27\n\n\fHello, Hello World\nx86-64 (gas \/ AT&T syntax) - Application\n\nx86-64 (gas \/ AT&T syntax) - Kernel (main OS program)\n\nPre-registered to be called on syscall\nSaves CPU state\n\nA jump to the kernel\n\nPerforms action\nRestores state\n\nReturns to process\n\n28\n\n\fTick tock tick tock merrily sings the clock\n• A hardware timer can preempt (forcibly pause) a program at any time.\n▪ Interrupts that occur at any instruction are asynchronous interrupts.\n\n• In a preemptive operating system, a hardware timer is used to give a\nmaximum bound to how long a process runs.\n▪ Your operating system programs the timer such that it sends a signal at a\nregular interval.\n▪ Your operating system has a function that is called when such a signal is read.\n▪ That function will respond by invoking the scheduler and pausing the current\ntask and resuming or starting another.\n\n• Let’s look at the basic procedure an OS uses to program an interrupt.\n29\n\n\fProgramming interruption\n• On most hardware, there is a programmable table somewhere in\nmemory that, when written to, defines where code exist to handle\neach interrupt.\n• Every possible interrupt is given a number. Segmentation faults might\nbe interrupt 10. Timers might be interrupt 0. Et cetera.\n• When an interrupt occurs, based on its interrupt number, the\ncorresponding entry in a lookup table called an interrupt vector table\nor an interrupt descriptor table would be used to determine where in\nthe kernel to jump.\n30\n\n\fThe Interrupt Table\n#\n\nValue\n\n• The interrupt table is a simple table.\n\nDescription\nDivide by zero\n\n• Fun Fact: It is often located at\naddress 0x0 in memory!\n\nOverflow\nDouble Fault\nGeneral Protection Fault\nPage Fault\nStack Fault\nAlignment Error\n...\nTimer Signal\nNetwork Device Signal\n\n▪ So, operating system kernels can’t\nexactly always treat zero as an invalid\naddress…\n\n• When a process triggers a listed\ninterrupt or external hardware sends\na signal to the interrupt controller…\n▪ the CPU jumps to the given address.\n\nAudio Device Signal\n\n31\n\n\fAh!

interrupt is the likely\ncause of our prior\ninterruption.\n• The interrupt handler is the\ncode that handles context\nswitching and scheduling\n32\n\n\fOverview\n• Interrupts can be categorized in several ways:\n▪ They can occur outside of our program:\nhardware exceptions\n▪ They can occur on an instruction in our program: software trap\n▪ They can occur at any time:\nasynchronous interrupts\n▪ They can occur at specific times:\nsynchronous interrupts\n\n• Interrupts are what allow operating systems to function!\n▪ When you press a key on your keyboard.\n▪ When you receive a packet on the network.\n▪ When your sound card wants the next second of audio.\n▪ When you divide by zero…\n• To then mercilessly murder your
