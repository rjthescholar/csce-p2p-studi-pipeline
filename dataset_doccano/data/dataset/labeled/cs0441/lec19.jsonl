Assume that only the type of fruit chosen matters, not the\nindividual piece.\nThis is TEDIOUS!!!\n\nSolution #1: Explicit enumeration\n4 apples\n3 apples, 1 orange\n3 oranges, 1 pear\n2 apples, 2 oranges\n2 apples, 1 orange, 1 pear\n\n4 oranges\n3 apples, 1 pear\n3 pears, 1 apple\n2 apples, 2 pears\n2 oranges, 1 apple, 1 pear\n\n4 pears\n3 oranges, 1 apple\n3 pears, 1 orange\n2 oranges, 2 pears\n2 pears, 1 apple, 1 orange\n\nSo, there are 15 possible 4-combinations of a set containing 3\nitems if repetition is allowed\n\n\fLet\u2019s find a nice closed-form expression for\ncounting r-combinations with repetition\nExample: Consider a cash box containing $1 bills, $2 bill, $5 bills,\n$10 bill, $20 bills, $50 bills, and $100 bills. How many ways are\nthere to choose 5 bills if order does not matter and bills within a\nsingle denomination are indistinguishable from one another?\nAssume that there are at least 5 bills of each denomination.\n\nObservations:\nl 7 denominations of bills\nl The order that bills are drawn does not matter\nl At least 5 bills of each denomination\n\nImplication: We are counting 5-combinations with repetition from a\nset of 7 items.\n\n$1\n\n$2\n\n$5\n\n$10\n\n$20\n\n$50\n\n$100\n\n\fAn interesting insight\u2026\nNote:\nl The cash box has 7 compartments\nl These compartments are separated by 6 dividers\nl Choosing 5 bills is the same as arranging 5 placeholders (*) and 6 dividers (|)\n\nExamples:\n1. |||**|||***\n\n$1\n$1\n$1\n\n$10\n$10\n\n2. *|*|**||*||\n\n$5\n\n$20\n$20\n\n$50\n\n$100\n\n\fThis leads us to a nice formula\u2026\nObservation: Arranging 5 stars and 6 bars is the same as choosing\n5 \u201cplaces\u201d for the stars out of 11 total \u201cplaces.\u201d\n\n*\n\n|\n\n*\n\n*\n\n|\n\n|\n\n*\n\n|\n\n*\n\n|\n\n|\n\nThis can be done in C(11, 5) = 462 ways.\n\nGeneral Theorem: There are C(n+r-1, r) r-combinations from a\nset with n elements when repetition of elements is allowed.\n\n\fBuying cookies!\nExample: How many ways can we choose six cookies at a cookie\nshop that makes 4 types of cookie? Assume that only the type of\ncookies chosen matters (not the order in which they are chosen or\nthe individual cookies within a given type).\n\nSolution #1:\nl Need six \u201cstars\u201d since we are choosing\nsix cookies\nl Need 3 \u201cbars\u201d to separate the cookies\nby type\nl So, C(9, 6) = 84 ways to choose places\nto put stars.\n\nSolution #2:\nl Since we choose six cookies, r = 6\nl Four possible cookie types means n = 4\nl So, C(6+4-1, 6) = C(9,6) = 84 ways to choose cookies!\n\n\fSolving equations\nExample: How many solutions does the equation x1 + x2 + x3 = 11\nhave if x1, x2, and x3 are non-negative integers?\n\nObservation: Solving this problem is the same as choosing 11\nobjects from a set of 3 objects such that x1 objects of type one\nare chosen, x2 objects of type two are chosen, and x3 objects of\ntype three are chosen.\n\nSolution:\nln=3\nl r = 11\nl So, there are C(3+11-1,11) = C(13, 11) = 78\nways to solve this equation\n\n\fFormula Summary\nType\n\nRepetition?\n\nFormula\n\nr-permutation\n\nNo\n\n\ud835\udc5b!\n\ud835\udc5b\u2212\ud835\udc5f !\n\nr-combination\n\nNo\n\n\ud835\udc5b!\n\ud835\udc5f! \ud835\udc5b \u2212 \ud835\udc5f !\n\nr-permutation\n\nYes\n\n\ud835\udc5b!\n\nr-combination\n\nYes\n\n\ud835\udc5b+\ud835\udc5f\u22121 !\n\ud835\udc5f! \ud835\udc5b \u2212 1 !\n\n\fHow do we deal with indistinguishable items?\nExample: How many strings can be formed by permuting the\nletters of the word MOM?\nObservation: We can\u2019t simply count permutations\nof the letters in MOM.
