exists an integer k such\nthat x = 2k + 1.\n\nSince a and b are odd integers, we can derive:\na = 2i + 1 and b = 2j + 1 for some integers i and j\n\nThumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu\n\nMathematics Preliminaries\n\n\fProof by Construction\n\nLet a = 2i + 1 and b = 2j + 1, we have\na \u00d7 b = (2i + 1) \u00d7 (2j + 1)\n= 4ij + 2i + 2j + 1\n= 2(2ij + i + j) + 1\nThus, a \u00d7 b is an odd integer since there exists an integer\nk = 2ij + i + j such that a \u00d7 b = 2k + 1.\nNote: By showing a couple of test cases is not a proof\nIn the above proof, we

to show that the statement P is True, we need to show\nthat the statement \u00acP \u2192 False is true.\nFrom previous example, we need to assume that \u00acP is true (or\nP is false) and try to derive a false statement\nA false statement is a statement that contradict with an\ninitial assumption, a hypotheses, a statement that have been\nderived previously, or another generally accepted
