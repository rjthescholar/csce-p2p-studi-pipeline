logic,\nloops, conditional branching, and had\nsome primitive memory\n\u2022 Powered by a hand-crank\n\u2022 The full-scale version was never built, due\nto inadequate funding\n\n\fAnalytical Engine\n\u2022 Accepted two kinds\nof punch cards:\n\u2013 Top: \"Variable Cards\"\n(Data)\n\u2013 Bottom: \"Operational\nCards\" (Instructions)\n\n\u2022 Punch cards were\nnot new (used to\ndirect
