This course is geared towards nonmajors. Talk to your academic advisor.\n\n\fSyllabus\n\u2022 Can be found on Courseweb\n\n\fTeaching Style\n\u2022 Because this course is geared towards\nnon-majors, the course will be taught in\na human-language inspired manner.\n\u2022 However, students should recognize\nthat human languages are fluid and\nbendable. Programming languages\n(like Java) are not.\n\n\fThe Programming Mindset\nImagine talking to your (possibly\nimaginary) non-cooperative little\nbrother who claims to be following\ndirections, but taking them as literally\nas possible.\nThis is what it is like programming a\ncomputer.\n\n\fRegarding Collaboration\n\u2022 I encourage all of you to collaborate\nand learn from each other by doing the\nhomework.\n\u2022 The only requirement: please write at\nthe top of your homework who you\ncollaborated with. Leaving this\ninformation out while continuing to\ncollaborate constitutes cheating and is\nNOT PERMITTED.\n\n\fRegarding Plagiarism\n\u2022 Plagiarism, which includes copying or\nusing code from any source without my\napproval, is strictly prohibited.\n\u2022 First offense: A zero for the graded item\n\u2022 Second offense: A zero for the course\n\n\fAcademic Integrity\n\u2022 The University\u2019s official Academic\nIntegrity Policy can be found here:\nhttp://www.as.pitt.edu/fac/policies/acad\nemic-integrity\n\n\fHeader\n\u2022 For those of you that don't check your\ne-mail on a daily basis, you should start.\n\u2022 Questions should be asked as soon as\nyou have one.\n\n\fQuestions?\n\n\f", "label": [[-2, -1, "Concept"]], "Comments": []}
