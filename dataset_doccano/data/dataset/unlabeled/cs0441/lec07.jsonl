That is n = (2k + 1) for some integer k.\nl Note that n2 = (2k+1)2 = (4k2 + 4k + 1)\nl We can factor the above to get 2(2k2 + 2k) + 1\nl Since the above quantity is one more than even number, we\nknow that n2 is odd. \u2610\n\n\fDirect proofs are not always the easiest way to\nprove a given conjecture.\nIn this case, we can try proof by contraposition\nHow does this work?\nl Recall that p \u2192 q \u2261 \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp\nl Therefore, a proof of \u00acq \u2192 \u00acp is also a proof of p \u2192 q\n\nProof by contraposition is an indirect proof technique\nsince we don\u2019t prove p \u2192 q directly.\nLet\u2019s take a look at an example\u2026\n\n\fProve: If n is an integer and 3n + 2 is odd, then\nn is odd.\nFirst, attempt a direct proof:\nl Assume that 3n + 2 is odd, thus 3n + 2 = 2k + 1 for some k\nl Can solve to find that n = (2k \u2013 1)/3\nWhere do we go from here?!?\n\nNow, try proof by contraposition:\nl Assume n is even, so n = 2k for some k\nl 3(2k) + 2 = 6k + 2 = 2(3k + 1)\nl So, 3n + 2 is also even.\nl Since we proved \u00ac\u201cn is odd\u201d \u2192 \u00ac\u201c3n+2 is odd\u201d, we can\nconclude that \u201c3n + 2 is odd\u201d \u2192 \u201cn is odd\u201d \u2610\n\n\fProof by contradiction\nGiven a conditional p \u2192 q, the only way to reject this\nclaim is to prove that p \u2227 \u00acq is true.\nIn a proof by contradiction we:\n1. Assume that p \u2227 \u00acq is true\n2. Proceed with the proof\n3. If this assumption leads us to a contradiction, we can\nconclude that p \u2192 q is true\n\nLet\u2019s revisit an earlier example\u2026\n\n\fProve: If n is an integer and 3n + 2 is odd, then\nn is odd.\nProof:\nl Assume the negation, that 3n + 2 is odd, n is even (i.e., n = 2k)\nl 3n + 2 = 3(2k) + 2 = 6k + 2 = 2(3k + 1)\nl The above statement tells us that 3n + 2 is even, which is a\ncontradiction of our assumption that 3n + 2 is odd.\nl Therefore, we have shown that if 3n + 2 is odd, then n is also\nodd. \u2610\n\nNote that the mechanics/algebra is the same! But the line\nof argumentation is different\nWe can also use proof by contradiction in cases where\nwere the theorem to be proved is not of the form p \u2192 q\n\n\fProve: At least 10 of any 64 days fall on the\nsame day of the week\nProof:\nl Let p \u2261 \u201cAt least 10 of any 64 days fall on the same day of\nthe week\u201d\nl Assume \u00acp is true, that is \u201cAt most 9 of any 64 days fall on\nthe same day of the week\u201d\nl Since there are 7 days in a week, at most 7\u00d7 9 = 63 days\ncan be chosen\nl This is a contradiction of the fact that we chose 64 days\nl Therefore, we can conclude that at least 10 of any 64 days\nfall on the same day of the week. \u2610\n\nThis proof is an example of the pigeonhole principle, which we will\nstudy during our combinatorics unit.\n\n\fIn-class exercises\nProblem 1: Prove the following claims\na) Use a direct proof to show that the square of an even\nnumber is an even number.\nb) Show that if m + n and n + p are even integers, then the\nsum m + p is also an even integer.\nc) Use proof by contraposition to show that if n is an integer\nand n3 + 5 is odd, then n is even.\n\n\fSadly, not all theorems are of the form p \u2192 q\nSometimes, we need to prove a theorem of the form:\np1 \u2228 p2 \u2228 \u2026 \u2228 pn \u2192 q\n\nNote: p1 \u2228 p2 \u2228 \u2026 \u2228 pn \u2192 q\n\nDistributive law\n\n\u2261 \u00ac(p1 \u2228 p2 \u2228 \u2026 \u2228 pn) \u2228 q\n\u2261 (\u00acp1 \u2227 \u00acp2 \u2227 \u2026 \u2227 \u00acpn) \u2228 q\n\u2261 (\u00acp1 \u2228 q) \u2227 (\u00acp2 \u2228 q) \u2227 \u2026 \u2227 (\u00acpn \u2228 q)\n\u2261 (p1 \u2192 q) \u2227 (p2 \u2192q) \u2227 \u2026 \u2227 (pn \u2192 q)\nSo, we might need to examine multiple cases!\n\n\fProve that n2 + 1 \u2265 2n where n is a positive\ninteger with 1 \u2264 n \u2264 4\nProof:\nl n = 1: (1)2 + 1 = 2, 2(1) = 2, and 2 \u2265 2\nl n = 2: (2)2 + 1 = 5, 2(2) = 4, and 5 \u2265 4\nl n = 3: (3)2 + 1 = 10, 2(3) = 6, and 10 \u2265 6\nl n = 4: (4)2 + 1 = 17, 2(4) = 8, and 17 \u2265 8\n\nSince we have verified each case, we have shown that n2\n+ 1 \u2265 2n where n is a positive integer with 1 \u2264 n \u2264 4. \u2610\nWith only 4 cases to consider, exhaustive proof was a good\nchoice!\n\n\fSometimes, exhaustive proof isn\u2019t an option, but we\nstill need to examine multiple possibilities\nExample: Prove the triangle inequality. That is, if x\nand y are real numbers, then |x| + |y| \u2265 |x + y|.\nClearly, we can\u2019t use exhaustive proof here since\nthere are infinitely many real numbers to consider.\nWe also can\u2019t use a simple direct proof either, since\nour proof depends on the signs of x and y.\n\n\fExample: Prove that if x and y are real numbers, then\n|x| + |y| \u2265 |x + y|.\nn \u2026 on the board!\n\n\fMaking mistakes when using proof by cases is all\ntoo easy!\nMistake 1: Proof by \u201ca few cases\u201d is not equivalent to\nproof by cases.\nThis is a \u201cthere exists\u201d proof,\nnot a \u201cfor all\u201d proof!\n\nExample: Prove that all odd numbers are prime.\n\u201cProof:\u201d\nl Case (i): The number 1 is both odd and prime\nl Case (ii): The number 3 is both odd and prime\nl Case (iii): The number 5 is both odd and prime\nl Case (iv): The number 7 is both odd and prime\n\nThus, we have shown that odd numbers are prime. \u2610\n\n\fMaking mistakes when using proof by cases is all\ntoo easy!\nMistake 2: Leaving out critical cases.\nExample: Prove that x2 > 0 for all integers x\n\u201cProof:\u201d\nl Case (i): Assume that x < 0. Since the product of two\nnegative numbers is always positive, x2 > 0.\nl Case (ii): Assume that x > 0. Since the product of two\npositive numbers is always positive, x2 > 0.\n\nSince we have proven the claim for all cases, we can\nconclude that x2 > 0 for all integers x. \u2610\nWhat about the case in which x = 0?\n\n\fSometimes we need to prove the existence of a\ngiven element\nThere are two ways to do this\nProve the claim by showing how to construct\nan example\n\nThe constructive approach\nShow that it is guaranteed that such an\nelement exists\n\nThe non-constructive approach\n\n\fA constructive existence proof\nProve: Show that there is a positive integer that can\nbe written as the sum of cubes of positive integers in\ntwo different ways.\n\nProof: 1729 = 103 + 93 = 123 + 13 \u2610\nObviously, the claim has been proven because we have\nshown that a specific instance of the claim is valid.\nConstructive existence proofs are really just instances of\n\u201cexistential generalization.\u201d\n\n\fA non-constructive existence proof\nProve: Show that there exist two irrational numbers x\nand y such that xy is rational.\n\nProof:\nl We know that \u221a2 is irrational, so let x = \u221a2\nl If \u221a2\u221a2 is rational, then we are done! (i.e., x = y = \u221a2)\nl If \u221a2\u221a2 is irrational, then let x = \u221a2\u221a2 and y = \u221a2, both of which\nare irrational\nl Now, xy = (\u221a2\u221a2)\u221a2 = \u221a22 = 2, which is rational (i.e., 2 = 2/1) \u2610\n\nNote: We don\u2019t know whether \u221a2\u221a2 is rational or\nirrational. However, in either case, we can use it to\nconstruct a rational number.\n\n\fSometimes, existence is not enough and we\nneed to prove uniqueness\nThis process has two steps:\n1. Provide an existence proof\n2. Show that any other solution to the problem is equivalent to\nthe solution generated in step 1\n\nExample: Prove that if a and b are real numbers, then\nthere exists a unique real number r such that ar + b = 0\nExistence\n\nProof:\nl\nl\nl\n\nNote that r = -b/a is a solution to this equality since\na(-b/a) + b = -b + b = 0.\nAssume that as + b = 0, s \u2260 r\nThen as = -b, so s = -b/a = r, which is a contradiction\n\n\u2610\n\nUniqueness\n\n\fThe scientific process is not always\nstraightforward\u2026\n\nConjecture\n\nGather evidence,\nprove lemmas\n\nProve\ntheorem\n\n\fProof strategies can help preserve your sanity\nProof strategies help us\u2026\n\nOrganize our problem\nsolving approach\n\nEffectively use all of the\ntools at our disposal\n\nDevelop a coherent plan\nof attack\n\n\fTypes of proof strategy\nToday we\u2019ll discuss four types of strategy:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nForward reasoning\nBackward reasoning\nSearching for counterexamples\nAdapting existing proofs\n\n\fSometimes forward reasoning doesn\u2019t work\nIn these cases, it is often helpful to reason backwards,\nstarting with the goal that we want to prove.\n\nExample: Prove that given two distinct positive real\nnumbers x and y, the arithmetic mean of x and y is\nalways greater than the geometric mean of x and y.\n\n(x + y)/2\n\n\u221a(xy)\n\nSanity check: Let x=8 and y=4. (8+4)/2 = 6. \u221a(8\u00d74) =\n\u221a(32) \u2245 5.66. 6 > 5.66\n\n\fProve that (x+y)/2 > \u221a(xy) for all distinct pairs of\npositive real numbers x and y.\nProof:\n(x + y)/2 > \u221a(xy)\n(x + y)2/4 > xy\n(x + y)2 > 4xy\nx2 + 2xy + y2 > 4xy\nx2 - 2xy + y2 > 0\n(x \u2013 y)2 > 0\nSince (x \u2013 y)2 > 0 whenever x \u2260 y, the final inequality is\ntrue. Since all of these inequalities are equivalent,\nit follows that (x + y)/2 > \u221a(xy). \u2610\n\n\fOther times, searching for a counterexample is helpful\n\nProof by counterexample is helpful if:\nl Proof attempts repeatedly fail\nl The conjecture to be proven looks \u201cfunny\u201d\n\nExample: Prove that every positive integer is the sum of\ntwo squares.\nThis seems suspicious to me, since other factorizations\n(e.g., prime factorizations) can be complex.\n\nCounterexample:\n3 is not the sum of two squares, so the claim is false. \u2610\n\n\fThese four proof strategies are just a start!\nA great tool for programmers AND logicians!\n\nWhen trying to prove a new conjecture, a good \u201cmeta\nstrategy\u201d is to:\n1. If possible, try to reuse an existing proof (analogy!)\n2. If the conjecture looks fishy, check for a counterexample\n3.

Is your proof constructive or non-constructive?\nProblem 3: Prove that there is no positive integer n\nsuch that n2 + n3 = 100.\nProblem 4: Use proof by cases to show that\nmin(a, min(b,c)) = min(min(a,b),c) whenever a, b, and\nc are real numbers.\n\n\fFinal Thoughts\nn Proving theorems is not always straightforward\nn Having several proof strategies at your disposal will\nmake a huge difference in your success rate!\nn We are \u201cdone\u201d with our intro to logic and proofs\nn Next lecture:\nl Intro to set theory\nl Please read sections 2.1 and 2.2\n\n\f", "label": [[-2, -1, "Concept"]], "Comments": []}
