We use the notation an\nto denote the image of the integer n. an is called a\nterm of the sequence.\n\nExamples:\nl 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11\nl 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, \u2026\n\nA sequence with 6 terms\nAn infinite sequence\n\nNote: The second example can be described as the\nsequence {an} where an = 1/n\n\n\fWhat makes sequences so special?\nQuestion: Aren\u2019t sequences just sets?\nAnswer: The elements of a sequence are members of a\nset, but a sequence is ordered, a set is not.\n\nQuestion: How are sequences different from ordered\nn-tuples?\nAnswer: An ordered n-tuple is ordered, but always\ncontains n elements. Sequences can be infinite!\n\n\fSome special sequences\nGeometric progressions are sequences of the form\n{arn} where a and r are real numbers\n\nExamples:\nl 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, \u2026\nl 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, \u2026\n\na = 1, r = \u00bd\na = 1, r = -1\n\nArithmetic progressions are sequences of the form\n{a + nd} where a and d are real numbers.\n\nExamples:\nl 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, \u2026\nl -10, -15, -20, -25, \u2026\n\na = 2, d = 2\na = -10, d = -5\n\n\fSometimes we need to figure out the formula for a\nsequence given only a few terms\nQuestions to ask yourself:\n1. Are there runs of the same value?\n2. Are terms obtained by multiplying the previous value by a\nparticular amount? (Possible geometric sequence)\n3. Are terms obtained by adding a particular amount to the\nprevious value? (Possible arithmetic sequence)\n4. Are terms obtained by combining previous terms in a\ncertain way?\n5. Are there cycles amongst terms?\n\n\fWhat are the formulas for these sequences?\nProblem 1: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, \u2026\nl Arithmetic sequence with a = 1, d = 4\n\nProblem 2: 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, \u2026\nl Geometric sequence with a = 1, r = 3\n\nProblem 3: 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, \u2026\nl Sequence in which the nth prime number is listed n times\n\nProblem 4: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, \u2026\nl Each term is the sum of the two previous terms\nThis is called the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n\fSometimes we want to find the sum of the terms\nin a sequence\nSummation notation lets us compactly\nrepresent the sum of terms am + am+1 + \u2026 + an\nUpper limit\n\nIndex of summation\n\nLower limit\n\nExample: \u22111\u2264i\u22645 i2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 55\n\n\fThe usual laws of arithmetic still apply\n$\n\n$\n\n$\n\n$\n\n! \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65! + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc66! \u2212 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc67! = \ud835\udc4e ! \ud835\udc65! + \ud835\udc4f ! \ud835\udc66! \u2212 \ud835\udc50 ! \ud835\udc67!\n!\"#\n\n!\"#\n\n!\"#\n\n!\"#\n\nConstant factors can be pulled out of the\nsummation\nA summation over a sum (or difference) can be split into a\nsum (or difference) of smaller summations\n\nExample:\nl \u22111\u2264j\u22643 (4j + j2) = (4+1) + (8+4) + (12+9) = 38\nl 4\u22111\u2264j\u22643 j + \u22111\u2264j\u22643 j2 = 4(1+2+3) + (1+4+9) = 38\n\n\fExample sums\nExample: Express the sum of the first 50 terms of the\nsequence 1/n2 for n = 1, 2, 3, \u2026\nAnswer:\n\nExample: What is the value of\nAnswer:\n\n\fWe can also compute the summation of the\nelements of some set\nExample: Compute\nAnswer: (0 + 2) + (2 + 2) + (4 + 2) + (6 + 2) = 20\n\nExample: Let f(x) = x3 + 1. Compute\nAnswer: f(1) + f(3) + f(5) + f(7) = 2 + 28 + 126 + 344 = 500\n\n\fSometimes it is helpful to shift the index of a\nsummation\nThis is particularly useful when combining two or more\nsummations. For example:\nLet j = k - 1\n\nNeed to add 1\nto each j\n\n\fSummations can be nested within one another\nOften, you\u2019ll see this when analyzing nested loops\nwithin a program (i.e., CS 1501/1502)\nExpand inner sum\n\nExample: Compute\nSolution:\nSimplify if possible\n\nExpand outer sum\n\n\fIn-class exercises\nOn Top Hat\n\n\fComputing the sum of a geometric series by\nhand is time consuming\u2026\nWould you really want to calculate\n\nby hand?\n\nFortunately, we have a closed-form solution for\ncomputing the sum of a geometric series:\n\nSo,\n\nWhy?\n\n\fProof of geometric series closed form\n\n\fThere are other closed form summations that\nyou should know\nSum\n\nClosed Form\n\n\fWe can use the notion of sequences to analyze\nthe cardinality of infinite sets\nDefinition: Two sets A and B have the same cardinality\nif and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence (a\nbijection) from A to B.\n\nDefinition: A finite set or a set that has the same\ncardinality as the natural numbers (or the positive\nintegers) is called countable. A set that is not\ncountable is called uncountable.\nImplication: Any sequence {an} ranging over the natural\nnumbers is countable.\n\n\fShow that the set of even positive integers is countable\n\nProof #1 (Graphical): We have the following 1-to-1\ncorrespondence between the positive integers and the\neven positive integers:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 \u2026\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 \u2026\nSo, the even positive integers are countable. \u274f\n\nProof #2: We can define the even positive integers as\nthe sequence {2k} for all k \u2208 Z+, so it has the same\ncardinality as Z+, and is thus countable. \u274f\n\n\fIs the set of all rational numbers countable?\nPerhaps surprisingly, yes!\n\nThis yields the sequence 1/1, 1/2, 2/1, 3/1, 1/3, \u2026, so the\nset of rational numbers is countable. \u274f\n\n\fIs the set of real numbers countable?\nNo, it is not. We can prove this using a proof method called\ndiagonalization, invented by Georg Cantor.\n\nProof: Assume that the set of real numbers is countable. Then\nthe subset of real numbers between 0 and 1 is also countable, by\ndefinition. This implies that the real numbers can be listed in\nsome order, say, r1, r2, r3 \u2026.\nLet the decimal representation these numbers be:\nr1 = 0.d11d12d13d14\u2026\nr2 = 0.d21d22d23d24\u2026\nr3 = 0.d31d32d33d34\u2026\n\u2026\nWhere dij \u2208 {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} \u2200i,j\n\n\fProof (continued)\nNow, form a new decimal number r=0.d1d2d3\u2026 where di = 0 if dii =\n1, and di=1 otherwise.\nExample:\nr1 = 0.123456\u2026\nr2 = 0.234524\u2026\nr3 = 0.631234\u2026\n\u2026\nr = 0.010\u2026\nNote that the ith decimal place of r differs from the ith decimal\nplace of each ri, by construction. Thus r is not included in the list\nof all real numbers between 0 and 1. This is a contradiction of\nthe assumption that all real numbers between 0 and 1 could be\nlisted. Thus, not all real numbers can be listed, and R is\nuncountable. \u274f\n\n\fFinal thoughts\nn Sequences allow us to represent (potentially\ninfinite) ordered lists of elements\nn Summation notation is a compact representation for\nadding together the elements of a sequence\nn We can use sequences to help us compare the\ncardinality of infinite sets\nn Next time:\nl Integers and division (Section 4.1)\n\n\f", "label": [[-2, -1, "Concept"]], "Comments": []}
