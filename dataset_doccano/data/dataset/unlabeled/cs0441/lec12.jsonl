If a number is not prime, it is called\na composite number.\n\nMathematically: p is prime \u21d4 \u2200 x\u2208Z+ [(x\u22601 \u2227 x\u2260p) \u2192 x /| p]\nExamples: Are the following numbers prime or composite?\nl 23\nl 42\n\nPrime\nComposite, 42 = 2\u00d7 3\u00d7 7\n\nl 17\nl 3\nl 9\n\nPrime\nPrime\nComposite, 9 = 32\n\n\fAny positive integer can be represented as a\nunique product of prime numbers!\nTheorem (The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic): Every\npositive integer greater than 1 can be written uniquely as a prime\nor the product of two or more primes where the prime factors are\nwritten in order of non-decreasing size.\n\nExamples:\nl 100 = 2\u00d7 2\u00d7 5\u00d7 5 = 22\u00d7 52\nl 641 = 641\nl 999 = 3\u00d7 3\u00d7 3\u00d7 37 = 33\u00d7 37\nl 1024 = 2\u00d7 2\u00d7 2\u00d7 2\u00d7 2\u00d7 2\u00d7 2\u00d7 2\u00d7 2\u00d7 2 = 210\n\nNote: Proving the fundamental theorem of arithmetic requires\nsome mathematical tools that we have not yet learned.\n\n\fThis leads to a related theorem\u2026\nTheorem: If n is a composite integer, then n has a\nprime divisor less than or equal to \u221an.\n\nProof:\nl If n is composite, then it has a positive integer factor a with\n1 < a < n by definition. This means that n = ab, where b is\nan integer greater than 1.\nl Assume a > \u221an and b > \u221an. Then ab > \u221an\u221an = n, which is a\ncontradiction. So either a \u2264 \u221an or b \u2264 \u221an.\nl Thus, n has a divisor less than or equal to \u221an.\nl By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, this divisor is\neither prime, or is a product of primes. In either case, n\nhas a prime divisor less than or equal to \u221an. \u274f\n\n\fApplying contraposition leads to a naive\nprimality test\nCorollary: If n is a positive integer that does not have\na prime divisor less than or equal to \u221an, then n is\nprime.\n\nExample: Is 101 prime?\nl The primes less than or equal to \u221a101 are 2, 3, 5, and 7\nl Since 101 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, it must be prime\n\nExample: Is 1147 prime?\nl The primes less than or equal to \u221a1147 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11,\n13, 17, 23, 29, and 31\nl 1147 = 31\u00d7 37, so 1147 must be composite\n\n\fThis approach can be generalized\nThe Sieve of Eratosthenes is a brute-force algorithm for finding all\nprime numbers less than some value n\nStep 1: List the numbers less than n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n245\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n31\n\n32\n\n33\n\n34\n\n35\n\n36\n\n37\n\n38\n\n39\n\n40\n\n41\n\n42\n\n43\n\n44\n\n45\n\n46\n\n47\n\n48\n\n49\n\n50\n\n51\n\n52\n\n53\n\n54\n\n55\n\n56\n\n57\n\n58\n\n59\n\n60\n\n61\n\n62\n\n63\n\n64\n\n65\n\n66\n\n67\n\n68\n\n69\n\n70\n\n71\n\nStep 2: If the next available number is less than \u221an, cross out all\nof its multiples\nStep 3: Repeat until the next available number is > \u221an\nStep 4: All remaining numbers are prime\n\n\fHow many primes are there?\nTheorem: There are infinitely many prime numbers.\nProof: By contradiction\nl Assume that there are only a finite number of primes p1, \u2026, pn\nl Let Q = p1 \u00d7 p2 \u00d7 \u2026 \u00d7 pn + 1\nl By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, Q can be written as\nthe product of two or more primes.\nl Note that no pj divides Q, for if pj | Q, then pj also divides Q \u2013 p1\n\u00d7 p2 \u00d7 \u2026 \u00d7 pn = 1.\nl Therefore, there must be some prime number not in our list. This\nprime number is either Q (if Q is prime) or a prime factor of Q (if\nQ is composite).\nl This is a contradiction since we assumed that all primes were\nlisted. Therefore, there are infinitely many primes. \u274f\n\nThis is a non-constructive existence proof!\n\n\fIn-class exercises\nProblem 1: What is the prime factorization of 984?\nProblem 2: Is 157 prime?
