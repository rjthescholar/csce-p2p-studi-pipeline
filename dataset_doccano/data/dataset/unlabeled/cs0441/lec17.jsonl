This means that there are at most k\nitems, which is a contradiction of our assumption that\nwe have k+1 items, so at least one box must contain\nmore than one item. \u274f\n\n\fExamples\nExample: Among any group of 367\npeople there are at least two with the\nsame birthday, since there are only 366\npossible birthdays.\n\nExample: Among any 27 English\nwords, at least two will start with\nthe same letter.\n\n\fThe pigeonhole principle can be used to prove a\nnumber of interesting results\nClaim: Every integer n has a multiple whose decimal\nrepresentation contains only 1s and 0s\n\nProof:\n\nThis number has n+1 ones\n\nl Let n be a positive integer\nl Consider the set of n+1 integers S = {1, 11, 111, \u2026, 111\u20261}\nl Note that when any integer x is divided by n, there are n\npossible remainders (0 through n-1)\nl Since S contains n+1 elements, at least two elements of S\nhave the same remainder when divided by n (call them x\nand y, with x > y)\nl Since x \u2261 y (mod n), n | (x \u2013 y), and thus na = (x \u2013 y)\nl Finally, we note that x \u2013 y contains only 0s and 1s \u274f\n\n\fIn-class exercises\nTop Hat\n\n\fThere is a more general form of the pigeonhole\nprinciple that is even more useful\nThe generalized pigeonhole principle: If N objects are\nplaced into k boxes, then there is at least one box\ncontaining at least \u2308N/k\u2309 items.\n\nProof:\nl Assume that no box contains more than \u2308N/k\u2309 - 1 objects\nl Note that \u2308N/k\u2309 < (N/k) + 1\nl So, k (\u2308N/k\u2309 - 1) < k((N/k + 1) \u2013 1) = N\nl This contradicts our assumption that we had N objects \u274f\n\n\fExample\nWhat is the minimum number of students needed to\nguarantee that at least six students receive the same\ngrade, if possible grades are A, B, C, D, and F?\n\nSolution:\nl Need the smallest integer N such that \u2308N/5\u2309 = 6\nl With 25 students, it would be possible (though maybe\nunlikely) to have 5 students get each possible grade\nl By adding a 26th student, we guarantee that at least 6\nstudents get one possible grade\nl So, the smallest such N is 5 \u00d7 5 + 1 = 26 \u274f\n\n\fFrom the casino\u2026\nHow many cards must be drawn from a standard 52card deck to guarantee that three cards of the same\nsuit are drawn?\n\nSolution:\nl Let\u2019s make 4 piles: one for each suit\nl We want to have \u2308N/4\u2309 \u2265 3\nl We can do this using 4 \u00d7 2 + 1 = 9 cards\n\nNote: We don\u2019t need 9 cards to end up with three\nfrom the same suit\u2014if we did, we could never get a\nflush in poker!\n\n\fWe can\u2019t always use the pigeonhole principle directly\nHow many cards would we need to draw to ensure\nthat we picked at least three hearts?\n\nIn the worst case, we would need to draw every club,\nspade, and diamond before getting three hearts\u2026\nSo, to guarantee three hearts, we need to draw 3 \u00d7\n13 + 3 = 42 cards!\n\n\fMa Bell\u2026\nWhat is the least number of area codes needed to\nguarantee that the 25 million phones in some state can\nbe assigned distinct 10-digit phone numbers of the\nform NXX-NXX-XXXX?\n\nSolution:\nl The product rule tells us that there are 8 million phone\nnumbers of the form NXX-XXXX\nl Think of phones as objects and phone numbers as boxes\nl By the generalized pigeonhole principle, we know that\nsome \u201cbox\u201d contains at least \u230825,000,000/8,000,000\u2309 = 4\n\u201cobjects\u201d\nl This means that we need 4 area codes to ensure that each\nphone gets a unique 10-digit number \u274f\n\n\fThis has been easy so far, right?\nUnfortunately, life isn\u2019t always easy!\nSometimes, we need to be clever when we are\ndefining our \u201cboxes\u201d or assigning objects to\nthem\n\nFor example\u2026\n\n\fSports!\nDuring a month with 30 days, a baseball team plays at\nleast one game per day, but no more than 45 games total.\nShow that there must be some period of consecutive days\nin which exactly 14 games are played.\n\nSolution:\nl Let aj be the number of games played on or before the jth day of\nthe month. Note that the sequence {aj} is strictly increasing.\nl Note also that {aj + 14} is also an increasing sequence\nl Now, consider a1, a2, \u2026, a30, a1 + 14, a2 + 14, \u2026, a30 + 14\nl There are 60 terms in this sequence, all \u2264 (45 + 14) = 59\nl By the pigeonhole principle, at least two terms are equal\nl Note: Each aj for j = 1, 2, \u2026, 30 is distinct, as is each aj + 14\nl This means there exists some ai that is equal to some aj + 14, so\n14 games were played from day j + 1 to day i \u274f\n\n\fNumber theory\nShow that among any n+1 positive integers not\nexceeding 2n, there must be an integer that divides\none of the other integers.\n\nProof:\nl Call our \ud835\udc5b + 1 positive integers \ud835\udc4e! , \ud835\udc4e\" , \u2026 , \ud835\udc4e#$!\nl Write each \ud835\udc4e% as 2&! \ud835\udc5e% , where \ud835\udc5e% is an odd positive integer\nand \ud835\udc58% is non-negative (i.e., \ud835\udc58% might be zero)\nl Note that there are \ud835\udc5b odd positive integers less than 2\ud835\udc5b\nl By the pigeonhole principle, at least two of \ud835\udc5e! , \ud835\udc5e\" , \u2026 , \ud835\udc5e#$!\nmust be equal\nl This means we have some \ud835\udc4e% = 2&! \ud835\udc5e% and some \ud835\udc4e' = 2&\" \ud835\udc5e%\nl If \ud835\udc58% < \ud835\udc58' , then \ud835\udc4e% \u2223 \ud835\udc4e' . If \ud835\udc58% > \ud835\udc58' , then \ud835\udc4e' \u2223 \ud835\udc4e% \u274f\n\n\fIn-class exercises\nProblem 4: Top Hat\nProblem 5: A drawer contains a dozen brown socks and a\ndozen black socks, all unmatched. How many socks must be\ndrawn to find a matching pair? How many socks must be\ndrawn to find a pair of black socks?\nProblem 6: Let A be some subset of {1, 2, \u2026, 50} where\n|A|=10. Show that there are at least three subsets of A that\nhave the same sum.
