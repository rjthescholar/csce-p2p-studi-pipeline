How many ways can the dogs be arranged?\n\nThere are six possible\narrangements of three\ndogs!\n\n\fCounting permutations\nIn general, we can use the product rule to count the\nnumber of permutations of a given set.\nGiven a set of n items, we have:\nl n ways to pick the 1st item in the permuted set\nl n-1 ways to pick the 2nd item in the permuted set\nl n-2 ways to pick the 3rd item in the permuted set\nl\u2026\nl 1 way to choose the last item in the permuted set\n\nSo, for a set of size n, we have n \u00d7 (n-1) \u00d7 (n-2) \u00d7 \u2026 \u00d7 1\n= n! ways to permute that set\n\n\fAnd the winner is\u2026\nExample: Six friends run in a foot race. How many\npossible outcomes of the race are there, assuming that\nthere are no ties?\n\nSolution:\nl 6 ways to choose 1st place\nl 5 ways to choose 2nd place\nl 4 ways to chose 3rd place\nl 3 ways to choose 4th place\nl 2 ways to choose 5th place\nl 1 way to choose last place\nl So there are 6! = 720 possible outcomes\n\n\fFunctions and permutations\nLet S be some set. If f: S \u2192 S is a bijection, then f\ndescribes a permutation of the set S.\n\nExample: Let S = {1, 2, 3}, f(1) = 3, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 1\n\nS=\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nf(S) =\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n\fMore often than not, we\u2019re only interested in\narranging a subset of a given set\nDefinition: An r-permutation is a permutation of some\nr elements of a set.\n\nExample: Let S = {Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave}. Then:\nl Dave, Bob is a 2-permutation of S\nl Carol, Alice, Bob is a 3-permutation of S\nl Bob, Dave is a 2-permutation of S\n\nRather than specifying a particular r-permutation of a\nset, we\u2019re usually more interested in counting the\nnumber of r-permutations of a set\n\n\fCounting r-permutations\nDefinition: We denote the number of r-permutations of\na set of size n by P(n, r). By the product rule:\n\n\ud835\udc5b!\n\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc5b, \ud835\udc5f = \ud835\udc5b \u00d7 \ud835\udc5b \u2212 1 \u00d7 \u2026 \u00d7 \ud835\udc5b \u2212 \ud835\udc5f + 1 =\n\ud835\udc5b\u2212\ud835\udc5f !\n\nExample: In a foot race between six people, how many\nways can the gold, silver, and bronze medals be\nassigned, assuming that there are no ties?\n\nSolution:\nl P(6, 3) = 6!/(6-3)! = 6!/3! = 720/6 = 120\nl So, 120 ways to assign medals\n\n\fThe traveling salesperson\nExample: A salesperson must visit 7 different cities.\nThe first and last cities of her route are specified by\nher boss, but she can choose the order of the other\nvisits. How many possible trips can she take?\n\nSolution:\nl Since first and last cities are fixed,\nwe must count the number of ways\nto permute the 5 remaining cities\nl So, there are 5! = 120 possible trips\nthat the salesperson can take.\n\n\fCounting strings\nExample: How many permutations of \u201cABCDEFG\u201d\ncontain the substring \u201cABC\u201d?\n\nSolution:\nl Observation: Treat \u201cABC\u201d as one character\nl Now, how many ways are there to permute\n{ABC, D, E, F, G}?\nl |{ABC, D, E, F, G}| = 5\nl 5! = 120 permutations contain the substring \u201cABC\u201d\n\n\fHow do we count unordered selections of\nobjects?\nExample: How many ways can we choose two objects\nfrom the set S =\n\nS1 =\n\n=\n\nS2 =\n\n=\n\nS3 =\n\n=\n\nConclusion: There are three 2-combinations of a set\nof size three.\n\n\fCounting r-combinations\nDefinition: Let C(n, r) denote the number of rcombinations of a set of size n. Then:\n\ud835\udc5b!\n\ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc5b, \ud835\udc5f =\n\ud835\udc5f! \ud835\udc5b \u2212 \ud835\udc5f !\n\nProof:\nl\n\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\n\nThe r-permutations of the set can be formed by finding all\nof the r-combinations of the set and then permuting each\nr-combination in each possible way\nThere are \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc5f, \ud835\udc5f ways to permute each possible rcombination\nSo, \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc5b, \ud835\udc5f = \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc5b, \ud835\udc5f \u00d7 \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc5f, \ud835\udc5f\nThis means that \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc5b, \ud835\udc5f = \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc5b, \ud835\udc5f /\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc5f, \ud835\udc5f\n= \ud835\udc5b!\u2044 \ud835\udc5b \u2212 \ud835\udc5f ! \u2044\ud835\udc5f!\n= \ud835\udc5b!\u2044 \ud835\udc5f! \ud835\udc5b \u2212 \ud835\udc5f ! \u274f\n\n\fAlternate notation\nNote 1: Sometimes, C(n, r) is read \u201cn choose r\u201d\n\nThis is intuitive, as C(n, r) specifies the number of\nways to choose r objects from a set of size n.\n\nNote 2: C(n, r) is often written as !\" . In this class, I\nwill use the notation C(n, r) exclusively.\n\n\fBe careful using the formula for C(n, r)\nUsing the formula for C(n, r) directly can result in\ndoing lots of multiplication\u2026\nInstead, note that much of the denominator cancels\nout terms in the numerator. For example:\n\n\fPoker Hands\nExample: Given a standard 52-card deck, how many 5\ncard poker hands can be drawn?\n\nSolution:\nl C(52, 5) = 52!/[5! 47!]\nl\n= (52 \u00d7 51 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 48)/(5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)\nl\n= 26 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 49 \u00d7 12\nl\n= 2,598,960 different hands\n\n\fChoosing participants\nExample: Say that a class consists of 30 students.\nHow many ways can 3 people be chosen from this class\nto participate in a survey?\n\nSolution:\nl Want to compute is \u201c30 choose 3\u201d\nl C(30, 3) = 30!/[3! 27!]\nl\n= (30 \u00d7 29 \u00d7 28)/(3 \u00d7 2)\nl\n= 10 \u00d7 29 \u00d7 14\nl\n\n= 4,060 ways to choose participants\n\n\fAn interesting observation\u2026\nNote: Given a set of size n, choosing r elements is the\nsame as excluding n-r elements.\nThis means that C(n, r) = C(n, n-r).\n\nProof:\nl C(n, n-r) = n!/[(n-r)! (n-(n-r))!]\nl\n= n!/[(n-r)! r!]\nl\n= n!/[r! (n-r)!]\nl\n= C(n, r)\n\nby simplification\nby the commutative property\nby definition \u274f\n\n\fPermutations and combinations can be used in\nconjunction with the product and sum rules!\nExample: Suppose the CS department has 11 faculty\nmembers and the Math department has 9 faculty members.\nHow many ways can a committee consisting of 4 CS faculty\nmembers and 3 Math faculty members be chosen?\n\nSolution:\nl C(11, 4) ways to choose 4 CS profs\nl For each of these, there are C(9, 3) ways to choose 3 Math profs\nl So, we need to compute C(11, 4) \u00d7 C(9, 3)\nl C(11, 4) \u00d7 C(9, 3) = 11!/(4! 7!) \u00d7 9!/(3! 6!)\nl\n= 84 \u00d7 330\nl\n\n= 27,720 ways!\n\n\fIn-class exercises\nTop Hat\n\n\fCombinations can be helpful when examining\nbinomial expressions\nDefinition: A binomial is an expression involving the sum of\ntwo terms.\nl For example (x + y) is a binomial, as is (3 + j)4.\n\nr-Combinations are also called binomial coefficients, since\nthey occur as coefficients in the expansions of binomial\nexpressions.\n\nExample:\n(x + y)3 = x3 + 3x2y + 3xy2 + y3\n= C(3,0)x3y0 + C(3,1)x2y1 + C(3,2)x1y2 + C(3,3)x0y3\n\n\fThe Binomial Theorem\nThe Binomial Theorem: Let x and y be variables, and\nlet n be a non-negative integer. Then:\n!\n\n\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc66 ! = / \ud835\udc36 \ud835\udc5b, \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc65 !&# \ud835\udc66 #\n#$%\n\nExample: Compute (x + y)2.\nl C(2, 0) = 1\nl C(2, 1) = 2\nl C(2, 2) = 1\nl (x + y)2 = x2y0 + 2x1y1 + x0y2\nl\n= x2 + 2xy + y2\n\n\u2714\n\n\fA small example\u2026\nQuestion: What is the coefficient of x12y13 in the\nexpansion of (x+y)25?\n\nSolution: By the binomial theorem, we know that this\nterm can be written as C(25,13)x12y13, so the\ncoefficient of x12y13 is C(25, 13) = 5,200,300.\n\n\fA slightly more complicated example\u2026\nQuestion: What is the coefficient of x12y13 in the\nexpansion of (2x-3y)25?\n\nSolution:\nl Note that (2x-3y)25 = (2x + (-3)y)25\nl The binomial theorem tells us that:\n2\ud835\udc65 + \u22123\ud835\udc66\n\n!\"\n\n!\"\n\n= 1 \ud835\udc36 25, \ud835\udc57 2\ud835\udc65 !\"&# \u22123\ud835\udc66 #\n#$%\n\nl Thus, the coefficient of x12y13 occurs when j = 13\nl C(25,13)(2x)25-13(-3y)13 = C(25,13)212(-3)13x12y13\nl So the coefficient = 25!/(13! 12!) 212 (-3)13\nl\n= -[25!/(13! 12!) 212 313]\n\n\fPascal\u2019s Identity\nPascal\u2019s identity: C(n+1, k) = C(n, k-1) + C(n, k)\n\nProof:\nl Let T be a set of n+1 elements\nl Let a \u2208 T, and S = T \u2014 {a}\nl By definition, there are C(n+1, k) subsets of T containing k\nelements\nl A subset of T containing k elements either contains k elements\nof S, or the element a along with k-1 elements of S\nl There are C(n, k) subsets of S containing k elements, so there\nare C(n, k) subsets of T not containing a.\nl Further, there are C(n, k-1) subsets of S containing k-1\nelements, so there are C(n, k-1) subsets of T containing a.\nl Thus, C(n+1, k) = C(n, k-1) + C(n, k) \u274f\n\n\fWe can use Pascal\u2019s identity to define C(n, r)\nrecursively\nBasis step: For all n, we have that C(n, 0) = C(n, n) = 1\nRecursive step: C(n+1, k) = C(n, k-1) + C(n, k)\n\nExample: Compute C(3,2).\nl C(3,2) = C(2,1) + C(2,2)\nl\n= C(1,0) + C(1,1) + 1\nl\n=1+1+1\nl\n=3\nl\n= 3!/(2!(3-2)!)\n\n\u2714\n\nUsing this definition, we can compute\nC(n, r) without using multiplication at\nall!\n\n\fIn-class exercises\nProblem 4: What is the coefficient of the term a7b8 in\n(a+b)15?\nProblem 5: Use the recursive definition of C(n, r) to\ncalculate C(5,3).\n\n\fFinal Thoughts\nn Permutations count the ways that we can shuffle a\nset (forming a sequence). r-Permutations count the\nnumber of ways that we can arrange r items from a\nset.\nn r-Combinations are useful when we want to count\n(unordered) subsets of a given set\nn Next time:\nl Generalized permutations and combinations\n\n\f", "label": [[-2, -1, "Concept"]], "Comments": []}
