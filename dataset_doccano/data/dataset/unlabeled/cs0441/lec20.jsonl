Finite number of possible outcomes\n2. Each outcome is equally likely\n\nCard games\nDice\n\nFlipping coins\n\nRoulette\n\nLotteries\n\n\fTerminology\nDefinitions:\nl An experiment is a procedure that yields one of a given set of\npossible outcomes\nl The sample space of an experiment is the set of possible outcomes\nl An event is a subset of the sample space\nl Given a finite sample space S of equally-likely outcomes, the\nprobability of an event E is p(E) = |E|/|S|.\n\nExample:\nl Experiment: Roll a single 6-sided die one time\nl Sample space: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nl One possible event: Roll an even number \u21d2 {2, 4, 6}\nl The probability of rolling an even number is\n|{2, 4, 6}| / |{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}| = 3/6 = 1/2\n\n\fSolving these simplified finite probability\nproblems is \u201ceasy\u201d\nI told you that combinatorics and\nprobability were related!\n\nStep 1: Identify and\ncount the sample space\n\n/\n\nStep 3: Divide!\n\nStep 2: Count the size of\nthe desired event space\n\n\fWhen two dice are rolled, what is the probability that\nthe sum of the two numbers is seven?\nStep 1: Identify and count sample space\nl Sample space, S, is all possible pairs of numbers 1-6\nl Product rule tells us that |S| = 62 = 36\n\nStep 2: Count event space\nl (1, 6)\nl (2, 5)\nl (3, 4)\nl (4, 3)\nl (5, 2)\nl (6, 1)\n\n|E| = 6\n\nStep 3: Divide\nl Probability of rolling two dice that sum to 7 is p(E)\nl p(E) = |E|/|S| = 6/36 = 1/6\n\n\fBalls and Bins\nExample: A bin contains 4 green balls and 5 red balls.\nWhat is the probability that a ball chosen from the bin\nis green?\n\nSolution:\nl 9 possible outcomes (balls)\nl 4 green balls, so |E| = 4\nl So p(E) = 4/9 that a green\nball is chosen\n\n\fHit the lotto\nExample: Suppose a lottery gives a large prize to a person who\npicks 4 digits between 0-9 in the correct order, and a smaller\nprize if only three digits are matched. What is the probability of\nwinning the large prize? The small prize?\n\nSolution:\nGrand prize\nl S = possible lottery outcomes\nl |S| = 104 = 10,000\nl E = all 4 digits correct\nl |E| = 1\nl So p(E) = 1/10,000 = 0.0001\n\nSmaller prize\nl S = possible lottery outcomes\nl |S| = 104 = 10,000\nl E = one digit incorrect\nl We can count |E| using the sum rule:\nl\nl\nl\nl\n\n9 ways to get 1st digit wrong OR\n9 ways to get 2nd digit wrong OR\n9 ways to get 3rd digit wrong OR\n9 ways to get 4th digit wrong\n\nl So |E| = 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36\nl p(E) = 36/10,000 = 0.0036\n\n\fMega Lotteries\nExample: Consider a lottery that awards a prize if a person can\ncorrectly choose a set of 6 numbers from the set of the first 40\npositive numbers. What is the probability of winning this lottery?\n\nSolution:\nl S = All sets of six numbers between 1 and 40\nl Note that order does not matter in this lottery\nl Thus, |S| = C(40, 6) = 40!/(6!34!) = 3,838,380\nl Only one way to do this correctly, so |E| = 1\nl So p(E) = 1/3,838,380 \u2248 0.00000026\n\n:(\n\nLesson: You stand a better chance at being struck by\nlightning than winning this lottery!\n\n\fFour of a Kind\nExample: What is the probability of getting \u201cfour of a\nkind\u201d in a 5-card poker hand?\n\nSolution:\nl S = set of all possible poker hands\nl Recall |S| = C(52,5) = 2,598,960\nl E = all poker hands with 4 cards of the same type\nl To draw a four of a kind hand:\n\u27a3 C(13, 1) ways to choose the type of card (2, 3, \u2026, King, Ace)\n\u27a3 C(4,4) = 1 way to choose all 4 cards of that type\n\u27a3 C(48, 1) ways to choose the 5th card in the hand\n\u27a3 So, |E| = C(13,1)C(4,4)C(48,1) = 13 \u00d748 = 624\nl p(E) = 624/2,598,960 \u2248 0.00024\n\n\fA Full House\nExample: What is the probability of drawing a full house when\ndrawing a 5-card poker hand? (Reminder: A full house is three\ncards of one kind, and two cards of another kind.)\n\nSolution:\nl |S| = C(52,5) = 2,598,960\nl E = all hands containing a full house\nl To draw a full house:\n\u27a3 Choose two types of cards (order matters)\n\u27a3 Choose three cards of the first type\n\u27a3 Choose two cards of the second type\n\nl So |E| = 13 \u00d712 \u00d74 \u00d76 = 3,744\nl p(E) = 3,744/2,598,960 \u2248 0.0014\n\nP(13, 2) = 13 \u00d7 12 ways\nC(4, 3) = 4 ways\nC(4, 2) = 6 ways\n\n\fSampling with or without replacement makes a\ndifference!\nExample: Consider a bin containing balls labeled with the\nnumbers 1, 2, \u2026, 50. How likely is the sequence 23, 4, 3, 12, 48\nto be drawn in order if a selected ball is not returned to the bin?\nWhat if selected balls are immediately returned to the bin?\n\nSolution:\nl Note: Since order is important, we need to consider 5-permutations\nl If balls are not returned to the bin, we have P(50, 5) = 50 \u00d749 \u00d748 \u00d747 \u00d7\n46 = 254,251,200 ways to select 5 balls\nl If balls are returned, we have 505 = 312,500,000 ways to select 5 balls\nl Since there is only one way to select the sequence 23, 4, 3, 12, 48 in\norder, we have that\n\u27a3 p(E) = 1/254,251,200 if balls are not replaced\n\u27a3 p(E) = 1/312,500,000 if balls are replaced\n\n\fYes, calculating probabilities can be easy\n\nAnyone can divide two numbers!\nBut, Be careful when you:\nl Define the sets S and E\nl Count the cardinality of S and E\n\n\fIn-class exercises\nProblem 1: Consider a box with 3 green balls and 1 pink ball.\nWhat is the probability of drawing a pink ball? What is the\nprobability of drawing two green balls in two successive picks\n(without replacement)?\nProblem 2: In poker, a straight flush is a hand in which all 5\ncards are from the same suit and occur in order. For example, a\nhand containing the 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of hearts would be a straight\nflush, while the hand containing the 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 of hearts\nwould not be. Note that a royal flush (10 through A) is not\nconsidered a straight flush (but A through 5 is). What is the\nprobability of drawing a straight flush in poker?\nProblem 3: A flush is a hand in which all five cards are of the\nsame suit, but do not form an ordered sequence. What is the\nprobability of drawing a flush in poker?\n\n\fWhat about events that are derived from other\nevents?\nRecall: An event E is a subset of the sample space S\n\nS\n\nDefinition: p(E) = 1 \u2013 p(E)\nProof:\nl Note that E = S \u2013 E, since S is universe of all possible outcomes\nl So, |E| = |S| - |E|\nl Thus, p(E) = |E|/|S|\nby definition\nl\n= (|S| - |E|)/|S|\nby substitution\nE\nl\n= 1 - |E|/|S|\nsimplification\nl\n= 1 \u2013 p(E) \u274f\nby definition\n\nWhy is this useful?\n\nE\n\n\fSometimes, counting |E| is hard!\nExample: A 10-bit sequence is randomly generated. What is the\nprobability that at least 1 bit is 0?\n\nSolution:\nl S = all 10-bit strings\nl |S| = 210\nl E = all 10-bit strings with at least 1 zero\nl E = all 10-bit strings with no zeros = {1111111111}\nl p(E) = 1 \u2013 p(E)\nl\n= 1 \u2013 1/210\nl\n= 1 \u2013 1/1024\nl\n= 1023/1024\nSo the probability of a randomly generated 10-bit string\ncontaining at least one 0 is 1023/1024.\n\n\fWe can also calculate the probability of the\nunion of two events\nDefinition: If E1 and E2 are two events in the sample space S,\nthen p(E1 \u222a E2) = p(E1) + p(E2) \u2013 p(E1 \u2229 E2).\n\nS\nE1\n\nE2\n\nProof:\nl Recall: |E1 \u222a E2| = |E1| + |E2| - |E1 \u2229 E2|\nl p(E1 \u222a E2) = |E1 \u222a E2|/ |S|\nl\n= (|E1| + |E2| - |E1 \u2229 E2|) / |S|\nl\n= |E1|/|S| + |E2|/|S| - |E1 \u2229 E2|/|S|\nl\n= p(E1) + p(E2) - p(E1 \u2229 E2)\n\nWhy does this look\nfamiliar?\n\n\fDivisibility\u2026\nExample: What is the probability that a positive integer not\nexceeding 100 is divisible by either 2 or 5?\n\nSolution:\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\nl\n\nLet E1 be the event that an integer is divisible by 2\nLet E2 be the event that an integer is divisible by 5\nE1 \u222a E2 is the event that an integer is divisible by 2 or 5\nE1 \u2229 E2 is the event that an integer is divisible by 2 and 5\n|E1| = 50\n|E2| = 20\n|E1 \u2229 E2| = 10\np(E1 \u222a E2) = p(E1) + p(E2) - p(E1 \u2229 E2)\n= 50/100 + 20/100 \u2013 10/100\n= 1/2 + 1/5 - 1/10\n= 3/5\n\n\fNot all events are equally likely to occur\u2026\n\nSporting events\n\nGames of strategy\n\nNature\n\nInvestments\n\n\fWe can model these types of real-life situations\nby relaxing our model of probability\nAs before, let S be our sample space. Unlike before,\nwe will allow S to be either finite or countable.\nWe will require that the following conditions hold:\n1. 0 \u2264 p(s) \u2264 1 for each s \u2208 S\n2.\n\n\u2211!\u2208# \ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc60 = 1\n\nNo event can have a negative\nlikelihood of occurrence, or more than\na 100% chance of occurrence\n\nIn 100% of experiments,\none of the outcome occurs\n\nThe function p : S \u2192 [0,1] is called a probability\ndistribution\n\n\fSimple example: Fair and unfair coins\nExample: What probabilities should be assigned to outcomes\nheads (H) and tails (T) if a fair coin is flipped? What if the coin\nis biased so that heads is twice as likely to occur as tails?\nCase 1: Fair coins\nnEach outcome is equally likely\nnSo p(H) = 1/2, p(T) = 1/2\nnCheck:\nl 0 \u2264 1/2 \u2264 1\nl 1/2 + 1/2 = 1\n\n\u2714\n\nCase 2: Biased coins\nnNote:\n1. p(H) = 2p(T)\n2. p(H) + p(T) = 1\n\nn2p(T) + p(T) = 1\nn3p(T) = 1\nnp(T) = 1/3, p(H) = 2/3\n\n\fAre the following probability distributions valid?\nWhy or why not?\nS = {1, 2, 3, 4} where\nl\nl\nl\nl\n\np(1) = 1/3\np(2) = 1/6\np(3) = 1/6\np(4) = 1/3\n\nS = {a, b, c}\nl p(a) = 3/4\nl p(b) = 1/4\nl p(c) = 0\n\n\u2714\n\u2714\n\nS = {1, 2, 3, 4} where\nl\nl\nl\nl\n\np(1) = 2/3\np(2) = 1/6\np(3) = -1/6\np(4) = 1/3\n\nS = {a, b, c}\nl p(a) = 1/2\nl p(b) = 1/4\nl p(c) = 0\n\n\fMore definitions\nDefinition: Suppose that S is a set with n elements.\nThe uniform distribution assigns the probability 1/n to\neach element of S.\nThe distribution of fair coin\nflips is a uniform distribution!\n\nDefinition: The probability of an event E \u2286 S is the\nsum of the probabilities of the outcomes in E. That is:\n\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc38 = %\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc60\n$\u2208&\n\n\fLoaded dice\nExample: Suppose that a die is biased so that 3 appears twice as\noften as each other number, but that the other five outcomes are\nequally likely. What is the probability that an odd number\nappears when we roll this die?\n\nSolution:\nl\nl\nl\nl\n\np(1) + p(2) + p(3) + p(4) + p(5) + p(6) = 1\nNote that p(1) = p(2) = p(4) = p(5) = p(6) and p(3) = 2p(1)\nSo, p(1) + p(1) + 2p(1) + p(1) + p(1) + p(1) = 7p(1) = 1\nThus p(1) = p(2) = p(4) = p(5) = p(6) = 1/7 and p(3) = 2/7\n\nl Now, we want to find p(E), where E = {1, 3, 5}\nl p(E) = p(1) + p(3) + p(5)\nl\n= 1/7 + 2/7 + 1/7\nl\n= 4/7\n\n\fIn-class exercises\nConsider a die in which (i) 1, 3, and 4 are rolled with the same\nfrequency, (ii) 2 is rolled 3 times as often as 1, (iii) 5 is rolled 2\ntimes as often as 4, (iv) and 6 is rolled 4 times as often as 2.\nProblem 4: What is the probability distribution for this die?\nProblem 5: What is the probability of rolling a 1 or a 3?\nProblem 6: What is the probability of rolling an even number?\nAn odd number?\n\n\fFinal Thoughts\nn Probability allows us to analyze the likelihood of\nevents occurring\nn Today, we learned how to analyze events that are\nequally likely, as well as those that have non-equal\nprobabilities of occurrence\nn Next time:\nl More probability theory (Section 7.2)\n\n\f", "label": [[-2, -1, "Concept"]], "Comments": []}
