If there are exactly n\nelements in S, where n is a nonnegative integer, then S\nis a finite set whose cardinality is n. The cardinality of S\nis denoted by |S|.\n\nExample: If S = {a, e, i, o, u}, then |S| = 5.\nUseful facts: If A and B are finite sets, then\nl |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\nl |A - B| = |A| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nAside: We'll talk about the cardinality of infinite sets\nlater in the course.\n\nPower set\nDefinition: Given a set S, its power set is the set\ncontaining all subsets of S. We denote the power set\nof S as P(S).\n\nExamples:\nl P({1}) = {\u2205, {1}}\nl P({1, 2, 3}) = {\u2205, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}\n\nNote:\nl The set \u2205 is in the power set of any set S: \u2200S(\u2205 \u2208P(S))\nl The set S is in its own power set: \u2200S(S\u2208P(S))\nl |P(S)| = 2|S|\nl Some authors use the notation 2S to represent the power\nset of S\n\nHow do we represent ordered collections?\nDefinition: The ordered n-tuple (a1, a2, ..., an) is the ordered\ncollection that has a1 as its first element, a2 as its second\nelement, ..., and an as its nth element.\n\nNote: (a1, a2, ..., an) = (b1, b2, ..., bn) iff ai = bi for i = 1, ..., n.\nSpecial case: Ordered pairs of the form (x \u2208 Z, y \u2208 Z) are the\nbasis of the Cartesian plane!\nl (a, b) = (c, d) iff a = c and b = d\nl (a, b) = (b, a) iff a = b\n\nHow can we construct and describe ordered n-tuples?\n\nWe use the Cartesian product operator to\nconstruct ordered n-tuples\nDefinition: If A and B are sets, the Cartesian product of A\nand B, which is denoted A\u00d7 B, is the set of all ordered\npairs (a, b) such that a \u2208 A and b \u2208 B.\n\nMathematically: A\u00d7 B = {(a, b) | a \u2208 A \u2227 b \u2208 B}\nExamples: Let A = {1, 2} and B = {y, z}\nl What is A\u00d7 B?\nl B\u00d7 A?\nl Are A\u00d7 B and B\u00d7 A equivalent?\n\n{(1, y), (1, z), (2, y), (2, z)}\n{(y, 1), (z, 1), (y, 2), (z, 2)}\n\nNO!!\n\nCartesian products can be made from more than\ntwo sets\nExample: Let\nl S = {x | x is enrolled in CS 441}\nl G = {x | x \u2208 R \u2227 0 \u2264 x \u2264 100}\nl Y = {freshman, sophomore, junior, senior}\n\nThe set S\u00d7 Y\u00d7 G consists of all possible (CS441\nstudent, year, grade) combinations.\nNote: My grades database is a subset of S\u00d7 Y\u00d7 G that\ndefines a relation between students in the class,\ntheir year at Pitt, and their grade!\nWe will study the properties of relations towards the\nend of this course.\n\nSets and Cartesian products can be used to\nrepresent trees and graphs\nDave\n\nCharlie\nAlice\n\nLet:\n\nElise\n\nBob\n\nNode\n\nBecky\n\nl N = All names\nl F = N\u00d7 N\n\nEdge\n\nFrank\nSarah\n\nTommy\n\nA social network can be represented as a graph (V, E) in which\nthe set V denotes the people in the network and the set E\ndenotes the set of \"friendship\" links: (V, E) \u2208 P(N)\u00d7 P(F)\nIn the above network:\nl V = {Alice, Bob, ..., Tommy} \u2286 N\nl E = {(Alice, Bob), (Alice, Dave), ..., (Sarah, Tommy)} \u2286 N\u00d7N\n\nSet notation allows us to make quantified\nstatements more precise\nWe can use set notation to make the domain of a\nquantified statement explicit.\n\nExample: \u2200x\u2208R (x2 \u2265 0)\nl The square of any real number is at least zero\n\nExample: \u2200n\u2208Z \u2203j,k\u2208Z [(3n+2 = 2j+1)\u2192(n = 2k+1)]\nl If n is an integer and 3n + 2 is odd, then n is odd.\n\nNote: This notation is far less ambiguous than simply\nstating the domains of propositional functions. In the\nremainder of the course, we will use this notation\nwhenever possible.\n\nTruth sets describe when a predicate is true\nDefinition: Given a predicate P and its corresponding\ndomain D the truth set of P enumerates all elements in\nD that make the predicate P true.\n\nExamples: What are the truth sets of the following\npredicates, given that their domain is the set Z?\nl P(x) \u2261 |x| = 1\nl Q(x) \u2261 x2 > 0\nl R(x) \u2261 x5 = 1049\n\n{-1, 1}\n{x | x\u2208Z\u00b1\u2227 x\u22600} -or- Z-{0}\n\u2205\n\nNote:\nl \u2200x P(x) is true iff the truth set of P is the entire domain D\nl \u2203x P(x) is true iff the truth set of P is non-empty\n\nHow do computers represent and manipulate\nfinite sets?\nObservation: Representing sets as unordered\ncollections of elements (e.g., arrays of Java Object\ndata types) can be inefficient.\nAs a result, sets are usually represented using either\nhash maps or bitmaps.\nYou'll learn about these in 1501, so today we'll focus on bitmap\nrepresentations.\n\nThis is probably best explained through an example...\n\nPlaying with the set S={x | x\u2208N, x<10}\nTo represent a set as a bitmap, we must first agree on\nan ordering for the set. In the case of S, let's use the\nnatural ordering of the numbers.\nNow, any subset of S can be represented using |S|=10\nbits. For example:\nl {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} = 0101 0101 01\nl {1, 1, 1, 4, 5} = 0100 1100 00\n\nWhat subsets of S do the following bitmaps represent?\nl 0101 1010 11\nl 1111 0000 10\n\n{1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}\n{0, 1, 2, 3, 8}\n\nSet operations can be carried out very\nefficiently as bitwise operations\nExample: {1, 3, 7} \u222a {2, 3, 8}\n0101 0001 00\n\u2228 0011 0000 10\n0111 0001 10 = {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}\n\nExample: {1, 3, 7} \u2229 {2, 3, 8}\n0101 0001 00\n\u2227 0011 0000 10\n0001 0000 00 = {3}\nNote: These operations are much faster than searching\nthrough unordered lists!\n\nSet operations can be carried out very\nefficiently as bitwise operations\nExample: {1, 3, 7}\n\u00ac0101 0001 00\n1010 1110 11 = {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}\nSince the set difference A - B can be written as A \u2229 (A \u2229 B),\nwe can calculate it as A \u2227 \u00ac(A \u2227 B).\n\nAlthough set difference is more complicated than the basic\noperations, it is still much faster to calculate set differences\nusing a bitmap approach as opposed to an unordered search.\n\nIn-class exercises\nProblem 4: Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, B = {3, 5, 7, 9}, and C\n= {7, 8, 9, 10}. Calculate the following:\nlA\u2229B\nlA\u222aB\u222aC\nlB\u2229C\nlA\u2229B\u2229C\n\nProblem 5: Come up with a bitmap representation of\nthe sets A = {a, c, d, f} and B = {a, b, c}. Use this to\ncalculate the following:\nlA\u222aB\nlA\u2229B\n\nFinal thoughts\nn Sets are one of the most basic data structures used\nin computer science\nn Today, we looked at:\nl How to define sets\nl Basic set operations\nl How computers represent sets\n\nn Next time:\nl Set identities (Section 2.2)\nl Functions (Section 2.3)\n\n", "label": [[191, 194, "Concept"], [214, 217, "Concept"],
