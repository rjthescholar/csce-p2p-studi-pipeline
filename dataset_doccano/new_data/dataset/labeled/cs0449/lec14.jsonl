Find the book. Etc.\n\u25aa Take the bus back.\n\n\u2022 Now it sits on your desk.\n\u25aa As long as it is near you, it is easy to access the\ninformation.\n\u25aa When we need another book... we put it aside.\n\u2022 Maybe a bookshelf.\n\n\u25aa The next time we need it, it will be nearby.\n12\n\nThe metaphorical cache\n\u2022 The bookshelf is a cache.\n\u25aa It holds information that you might want later.\n\n\u2022 It is [much] smaller than a library, but faster\nto retrieve things.\n\u2022 However, it is small. Placing a new book on\nthe shelf may require taking an old book off.\n\n13\n\nMemory cache (CPU)\n\u2022 RAM is the library. It is far away and getting\nstuff from there is slow.\n\u2022 To better handle the performance gap\nbetween the CPU and memory we add a\nsmaller, fast memory near the CPU.\n\u2022 This is the CPU cache.\n\n14\n\nData, the journey\n\u2022 When data is requested, the goal is to read\na word into a CPU register.\n\u2022 The CPU first contacts the cache and asks\nif it has a copy.\n\u25aa If it does... that is a cache hit, and, well, that was\neasy. Just copy that value into the register.\n\n\u2022 If it does not, this is a cache miss.\n\u25aa It will then contact the next component in the\nmemory hierarchy. (RAM)\n\n\u2022 Ram copies the value to cache, and the\ncache copies the value to the register.\n\n15\n\nMissing the mark\n\u2022 When the CPU requests memory in an\nempty cache, the data obviously won't be\navailable locally.\n\u2022 This is a compulsory miss, a \"miss\" due to\nthe first access of a block of data.\n\u25aa Also known as a \"cold miss.\"\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\n8\n\n\u2022 These are, as they suggest, completely\nunavoidable.\n\u25aa They always incur the high penalty associated\nwith a memory read.\n\n8\n\n16\n\nHitting the target\n\u2022 When the CPU requests memory that\nhappens to already be in the cache, the\ndata is read locally (quickly).\n\u2022 This is a cache hit.\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\n\u25aa Your best-case scenario.\n\n\u2022 These avoid having to communicate at all\nwith memory.\n\u25aa No penalty taken for reading/writing to\nmemory.\n\u25aa Very cheap in terms of time.\n\n8\n\n8\n\n17\n\nA cache half full...\n\u2022 As the CPU requests memory, the cache\nwill fill to satisfy each compulsory miss.\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\u2022 When it fills up completely, it will have no\nfurther room for the next miss.\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\n\u2022 On a miss, it requests the data from\nmemory.\n\n4\n\n6\n\nC\n\n1\n\n8\nE\n\n\u25aa Yet, where does it go?? We must remove one.\n\n\u2022 This is a capacity miss. The memory\nrequirements of the program are larger\nthan the cache.\n\n8\n\n18\n\nLooking closer...\n\u2022 It is difficult to know what block of data\nto omit from this cache on such a miss.\n\u25aa However we can exploit the common locality\npatterns of programs to improve our cache.\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n\u2022 There is temporal locality: accessed data\nis likely to be used again in near future.\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\n4\n\n6\n\nC\n\n1\n\n8\n\n\u25aa This is what caches generally capture.\n\n\u2022 However, spatial locality is also likely:\ndata is often grouped together.\n\u25aa When we access a struct field, we will often\naccess another which is nearby in memory.\n\n8\n\n19\n\nExploring space...\n\u2022 We would like to keep data that is\nadjacent in memory in the cache, together,\nat the same time.\n\u2022 To do this, we \"hash\" the address.

Block 1 is 0x40 to 0x79, etc.\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n64 bytes\n\n\u2022 Let's request 64-bit words in order starting\nat address 0x40 (Block 1)\n\u25aa There are 8 words in each cache block.\n\u25aa Therefore, we have only one compulsory miss.\n\u25aa And then we have 7 cache hits!!\n\n\u2022 If we request the ninth word, we will be at\naddress 0x80 (and a compulsory miss.)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n24\n\nOnce again...

Well...\n\u25aa Our \"slow\" program effectively did not use cache, and it was 10 times slower.\n\n\u2022 Simply: Caches offer much faster accesses than DRAM.\n\u25aa Perhaps 100s of times faster.\n\n\u2022 Consider the math:\n\u25aa miss rate (MR): Fraction of memory accesses not in cache.\n\u25aa hit rate (HR): Fraction of memory accesses found in cache. ( HR = 1 - MR )\n\u25aa hit time (HT): Time it takes to read a block from cache to CPU. (Best case)\n\u25aa miss penalty (MP): Time it takes to read from main memory to cache.\n29\n\nCache Performance\n\u2022 Recall that caches make computers practical.\n\u2022 Consider the math:\n\u25aa miss rate (MR): Fraction of memory accesses not in cache.\n\u25aa hit rate (HR): Fraction of memory accesses found in cache. ( HR = 1 - MR )\n\u25aa hit time (HT): Time it takes to read a block from cache to CPU. (Best case)\n\u25aa miss penalty (MP): Time it takes to read from main memory to cache.\n\n\u2022 Average Memory Access Time (AMAT): The time it takes, on average,\nto perform a memory request, considering the cache performance.\n\u25aa AMAT = HT + MR \u00d7 MP\n\n\u2022 Assuming a HT of 1 clock cycle and a MP of 100 clock cycles...\n\u25aa A HR of 97%: AMAT = 1 + 0.03 \u00d7 100 = 4 cycles\n\u25aa A HR of 99%: AMAT = 1 + 0.01 \u00d7 100 = 2 cycles\n\u25aa A hit-rate jump from just 97% to 99% doubles memory performance. Wow.\n\n30\n\nCache Layout Summary\n\u2022 We have seen two types of cache layouts.\n\u25aa A freeform cache: blocks go wherever.  \u0304\\_(\u30c4)_/ \u0304\n\u2022 Also called a fully associative cache.\n\n\u25aa A direct-mapped cache: blocks go into slots.\n\n\u2022 They have their own trade-offs, and as\nusual...\n\u25aa We can have a hybrid approach!\n\n\u2022 Here, each cache slot has multiple bins.\n\u25aa You only need to evict when you fill up the bins.\nBest of both worlds!\n\u25aa Which do you evict? (Hmm... difficult choice.)\n31\n\nAssociativity\n\u2022 With an associative cache, the address\ndetermines the slot.\n\u25aa Much like a direct-mapped cache.\n\u25aa However, the slot has a number of bins.\n\u25aa Any bin in the slot is viable for a block.\n\u25aa The number of bins is the number of \"ways\"\n\u2022 A direct-mapped cache is a 1-way cache.\n\n\u2022 When the cache determines if the block is in\nthe cache already...\n\u25aa It determines the slot.\n\u25aa It scans every bin for a block tagged with that\nexact address.\n\u25aa Therefore, the cache performance degrades as you\nincrease the number of ways.\n\n32\n\nAnother way of viewing it\nAll have the same size, so...\n\nOn a fully associative cache all\nblocks belong to the same set\n\nOn a direct-mapped cache all\nblocks belong to a different set\n\nOn a n-way associative cache n\nblocks belong to the same set\n\n33\n\nMapping\nWT F...Cache!?\n\nSooo... exactly what can go where?\n\u2022 Given a memory

technologies have different strengths (and costs)\n\u25aa Often trade-off between:\n\u2022 fast / small, expensive\n\u2022 slow / big, cheap\n\n\u25aa Hardware designs attempt to accommodate a variety of technologies.\n\u2022 Often using fast/small memories to act as a \"cache\" for slower ones.\n\n\u2022 Caches can be arranged in several ways:\n\u25aa Blocks go anywhere (fully-associative)\n\u25aa Blocks go in particular slots (direct-mapped / 1-way associative)\n\u25aa Hybrid: Blocks go to particular slots... but then can go in any bin in that slot.\n\n\u2022 Caches attempt to exploit temporal and spatial locality of programs.\n\u25aa And even a slight improvement to hit rate can dramatically improve overall\nperformance of a program!\n\n46\n\n", "label": [[610, 626, "Concept"], [1074,
