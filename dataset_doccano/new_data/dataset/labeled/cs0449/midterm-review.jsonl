The\nwrite overwrites line 0 again but since the cache is writeback nothing is written to memory.\n\nThe write evicts line 3 which was invalid and not\ndirty, so nothing is written to memory. The read,\nhowever, also maps to line 3 so it must write the\nvalue changed in the write back to memory before\nit can update the cache.\n\n(2) W 0x5500, W 0x7A00\n\n(4) R 0x3000, R 0x3000\n\nW 0b0101 0101... , W 0b0111 1010...\n\nR 0b0011 0000... , R 0011 0000...\n\nThe first write doesn't evict anything because the tags match.\nThe second write evicts the old data, but the dirty bit was not\nset so the old data doesn't need to be written back to memory.\n\nLine 0 is initially not dirty (and invalid) so nothing is\nwritten back to memory from either of these reads\n(which both read from the same line).\n\nImplementing LRU (Least Recently Used)\nBlock\n\nTag\n\nA\nE\nB\nC\nD\nBlock requests:\n\nValid LRU\n3\n0\n2\n\n\u00df least recent used\n\n1\n0\n2\n1\n3\n2\n3\n\nE\n\nD\n\nHow large (in bits) should the LRU counter be on\nan N-way set-associative cache?\n25\n\nVirtual Memory\n\nEnd-to-End Address Translation\n\n\u2022 Consider the following memory system:\n\n- The memory is byte addressable\n- Virtual addresses are 14 bits wide (n = 14)\n- Physical addresses are 12 bits wide (m = 12)\n- The page size is 64 Bytes (P = 64)\n- The L1 d-cache is physically addressed and direct\nmapped, with a 4-Byte line size and 16 total sets\n\nVirtual and physical addresses\n\n\u2022 14-bit virtual addresses (n = 14)\n\u2022 12-bit physical addresses (m = 12)\n\u2022 64-byte pages (P = 64)\n\nSnapshot of the page table\n\nSnapshot of the L1 d-cache\n\n4B-block\n\nPractice Problem 9.4 (CSAPP:3e)\n\n\u2022 Show how the example memory system\ntranslates a virtual address into a physical\naddress and accesses the cache\n\u2022 Given virtual address: 0x03d7\nWhat is the virtual address format?\n0 0\n\n0 0 1\n\n1\n\n1 1\n\n0 1\n\n0 1 1\n\n1\n\nAddress Translation\n\n0x0f\nN\n0x0d\n\n0x03d7\n\n0 | 0 | 0 | 0| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n0x0f\n\n0x17\n\n32\n\nPhysical Memory Access\n\n0x03\n0x05\n0x0d\nY\n0x1d\n\n0x0d\n\n0x03d7\n\n0x05\n\n0x03\n\n0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1\n0x0d\n\n0x17\n\nMemory Allocation\n\nDynamic storage allocation\n\u2022 Consider an allocator that uses an list.
