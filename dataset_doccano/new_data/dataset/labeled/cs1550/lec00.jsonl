Modify and compile the Linux kernel to add system\ncalls\n2. Write multi-process/multi-thread programs free\nfrom race conditions and deadlocks\n3. Simulate page-replacement algorithms for virtual\nmemory management\n4. Implement a user-land file system\nCS/COE 1550 - Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n2\n\nContact Info\n\u2022 Course website: http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~skhattab/cs1550/\n\u2022 Instructor: Sherif Khattab ksm73@pitt.edu\n\nOH: https://khattab.youcanbook.me\nTuTh: 16:30-19:30 (remote until Jan 26 then in-person/remote)\nF: 16:00-18:00 (remote only for the entire term)\n\u2022 6307 Sennott Square, Virtual Office: https://pitt.zoom.us/my/khattab\n\n\u2022 Teaching Team:\nTBD\n\n\u2022 Recitations start this week!\n\u2022 Communication\n1.\n\nEnd of week newsletter\n\n2.\n\nPiazza (Please expect a response within 72 hours)\n1.\n\nEmail not recommended!\nCS/COE 1550 - Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n3\n\nTextbook\n\nOperating System Concepts (9th Edition)\n\nSilberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne\n\nCS/COE 1550 - Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n4\n\nGrading\n\u2022 40% on 4 projects\n\u2022 System programming using C\n\u2022 Posted on Canvas and submitted on Gradescope (autograded)\n\n\u2022 20% on two exams: 12% on higher and 8% on lower\n\n\u2022 18% on weekly homework assignments\n\u2022 14% recitation: 5 labs using MIT's Xv6 operating\nsystem and 4 quizzes on the projects\n\u2022 8% in-class Tophat questions and discussions\n\nCS/COE 1550 - Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n5\n\nCanvas Walkthrough\n\u2022 Lectures posted on Tophat by end of each lecture\nday\n\u2022 Lecture and recitation recordings under Panopto\nVideo\n\u2022 Pre- and Post-course test\n\n\u2022 Piazza for discussion\n\u2022 Gradescope and autograding policies\n\u2022 Homework attempts\n\u2022 Academic Integrity\n\u2022 NameCoach\nCS/COE 1550 - Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n6\n\nExpectations\n\u2022 Your continuous feedback is important!\n\u2022 Anonymous Qualtrics survey\n\u2022 Midterm and Final OMET\n\n\u2022 Your engagement is valued and encouraged.\n\nCS/COE 1550 - Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n7\n\nLecture structure (mostly)\nTime\n\nDescription\n\n~5 min before and\nafter class\n~25 min\n\nInformal chat\n\n~40 min\n\nLecturing\n\n~5 min\n\nTophat questions and/or activities\n\n~5 minutes\n\nQA and muddiest points/reflections\n\nAnnouncements, review of\nreflections, and QA on\nprojects/labs/homework problems\n\nCS/COE 1550 - Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n8\n\nWhy is this class (notoriously) hard?\n\u2022 Lots of concepts\n\u2022 Attend lectures and recitations (if you absolutely cannot\nattend live, watch the video recordings)\n\u2022 Study often!\n\u2022 Put effort into the weekly homework assignments\n\n\u2022 Projects are relatively hard\n\u2022 Refresh your C programming and GDB debugging skills\n(CS 0449!)\n\u2022 Start early and show up to office hours!\n\nCS/COE 1550 - Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n9\n\n", "label": [[349, 361, "Concept"], [405, 426, "Concept"], [552, 573, "Concept"], [562, 573, "Concept"], [1359, 1377, "Concept"], [2874, 2887, "Concept"], [2892, 2895, "Concept"], [1572, 1575, "Concept"]]}
