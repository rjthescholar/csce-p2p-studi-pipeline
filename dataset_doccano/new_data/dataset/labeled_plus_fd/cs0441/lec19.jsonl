Assume that only the type of fruit chosen matters, not the\nindividual piece.\nThis is TEDIOUS!!!\n\nSolution #1: Explicit enumeration\n4 apples\n3 apples, 1 orange\n3 oranges, 1 pear\n2 apples, 2 oranges\n2 apples, 1 orange, 1 pear\n\n4 oranges\n3 apples, 1 pear\n3 pears, 1 apple\n2 apples, 2 pears\n2 oranges, 1 apple, 1 pear\n\n4 pears\n3 oranges, 1 apple\n3 pears, 1 orange\n2 oranges, 2 pears\n2 pears, 1 apple, 1 orange\n\nSo, there are 15 possible 4-combinations of a set containing 3\nitems if repetition is allowed\n\nLet's find a nice closed-form expression for\ncounting r-combinations with repetition\nExample: Consider a cash box containing $1 bills, $2 bill, $5 bills,\n$10 bill, $20 bills, $50 bills, and $100 bills. How many ways are\nthere to choose 5 bills if order does not matter and bills within a\nsingle denomination are indistinguishable from one another?\nAssume that there are at least 5 bills of each denomination.\n\nObservations:\nl 7 denominations of bills\nl The order that bills are drawn does not matter\nl At least 5 bills of each denomination\n\nImplication: We are counting 5-combinations with repetition from a\nset of 7 items.\n\n$1\n\n$2\n\n$5\n\n$10\n\n$20\n\n$50\n\n$100\n\nAn interesting insight...\nNote:\nl The cash box has 7 compartments\nl These compartments are separated by 6 dividers\nl Choosing 5 bills is the same as arranging 5 placeholders (*) and 6 dividers (|)\n\nExamples:\n1. |||**|||***\n\n$1\n$1\n$1\n\n$10\n$10\n\n2. *|*|**||*||\n\n$5\n\n$20\n$20\n\n$50\n\n$100\n\nThis leads us to a nice formula...\nObservation: Arranging 5 stars and 6 bars is the same as choosing\n5 \"places\" for the stars out of 11 total \"places.\"\n\n*\n\n|\n\n*\n\n*\n\n|\n\n|\n\n*\n\n|\n\n*\n\n|\n\n|\n\nThis can be done in C(11, 5) = 462 ways.\n\nGeneral Theorem: There are C(n+r-1, r) r-combinations from a\nset with n elements when repetition of elements is allowed.\n\nBuying cookies!\nExample: How many ways can we choose six cookies at a cookie\nshop that makes 4 types of cookie? Assume that only the type of\ncookies chosen matters (not the order in which they are chosen or\nthe individual cookies within a given type).\n\nSolution #1:\nl Need six \"stars\" since we are choosing\nsix cookies\nl Need 3 \"bars\" to separate the cookies\nby type\nl So, C(9, 6) = 84 ways to choose places\nto put stars.\n\nSolution #2:\nl Since we choose six cookies, r = 6\nl Four possible cookie types means n = 4\nl So, C(6+4-1, 6) = C(9,6) = 84 ways to choose cookies!\n\nSolving equations\nExample: How many solutions does the equation x1 + x2 + x3 = 11\nhave if x1, x2, and x3 are non-negative integers?\n\nObservation: Solving this problem is the same as choosing 11\nobjects from a set of 3 objects such that x1 objects of type one\nare chosen, x2 objects of type two are chosen, and x3 objects of\ntype three are chosen.\n\nSolution:\nln=3\nl r = 11\nl So, there are C(3+11-1,11) = C(13, 11) = 78\nways to solve this equation\n\nFormula Summary\nType\n\nRepetition?\n\nFormula\n\nr-permutation\n\nNo\n\nn!\nn-r !\n\nr-combination\n\nNo\n\nn!\nr! n - r !\n\nr-permutation\n\nYes\n\nn!\n\nr-combination\n\nYes\n\nn+r-1 !\nr! n - 1 !\n\nHow do we deal with indistinguishable items?\nExample: How many strings can be formed by permuting the\nletters of the word MOM?\nObservation: We can't simply count permutations\nof the letters in MOM. (Why not?)\nCounting permutations leads to an overcount!\nl Rewrite MOM as M1OM2\nl Possible permutations are:\n\u27a3 M1OM2\n\u27a3 M1M2O\n\u27a3 OM1M2\n\u27a3 M2OM1\n\u27a3 M2M1O\n\u27a3 OM2M1\n\nThese are really the same!\n\nHow do we fix this?\n\nRather than permuting all letters as a group,\narrange identical letters separately\nNote: The string MOM contains two Ms and one O.\nWe can count the distinct strings formed by permuting\nMOM as follows:\nl Set up 3 \"slots\" for letters\nl Count the ways that the 2 Ms can be\nassigned to the these slots\nl Count the ways that the O can be\nassigned to the remaining slots\nl Use the product rule!\n\nC(3,2) = 3\nC(1,1) = 1\nC(3,2) \u00d7 C(1,1) = 3\n\nThis tactic can be stated more generally\nTheorem: The number of different permutations of n\nobjects where there are n1 indistinguishable objects of\ntype 1, n2 indistinguishable objects of type 2, ..., and\nnk indistinguishable objects of type k is:\n\nC n, n! C n - n! , n\" ...

Treat our indistinguishable items as *s\n2. Use | to divide our distinguishable bins\n3. Count the ways to arrange n placeholders and k-1 dividers\n\nResult: There are C(n + k - 1, n) ways to place n indistinguishable\nobjects into k distinguishable boxes\n\nLet's see how this works...\nExample: How many ways are there to place 10 indistinguishable\nballs into 8 distinguishable bins?\n\nObservation:\n1. Treat balls as *s\n2. Use 8-1 = 7 dividers to separate bins\n3. Pick 10 positions out of a total 17\nto place balls (all remaining\npositions will be bin dividers)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nSolution: We have C(10 + 8 - 1, 10) = C(17, 10) = 19,448 ways to\narrange 10 indistinguishable balls into 8 distinguishable bins.\n\nSadly, counting the ways to place distinguishable items\ninto indistinguishable boxes isn't so easy...\nExample: How many ways can Anna, Billy, Caitlin, and Danny be\nplaced into three indistinguishable homerooms?\n\nSolution:\nl Let's call our students A, B, C, and D\nl Goal: Partition A, B, C, and D into at most 3 disjoint subsets\nl One way to put everyone in the same homeroom\n\u27a3\n\n{A, B, C, D}\n\nl Seven ways to put everyone in two homerooms\n\u27a3\n\u27a3\n\n{{A, B, C}, {D}}, {{A, B, D}, {C}}, {{A, C, D}, {B}}, {{B, C, D}, {A}}\n{{A, B}, {C, D}}, {{A, C}, {B, D}}, {{A, D}, {B, C}}\n\nl Six ways to put everyone into three homerooms\n\u27a3\n\u27a3\n\n{{A, B}, {C}, {D}}, {{A, C}, {B}, {D}}, {{A, D}, {B}, {C}}\n{{B, C}, {A}, {D}}, {{B, D}, {A}, {C}}, {{C, D}, {A}, {B}}\n\nl Total: 14 ways to assign Anna, Billy, Caitlin, and Danny to three\nindistinguishable homerooms\n\nIs there some simple closed form that we can use to\nsolve this type of problem?\nNo, but there is a complicated one J\nS(n, j) is a Stirling number of the second kind that tells us the\nnumber of ways that a set of n items can be partitioned into j\nnon-empty subsets.\nS(n, j) is defined as follows:\n\n$%&\n\nS n, j =\n\n1\n+ -1 !

C j, i j - i '\nj!\n\nWhat about distributing indistinguishable\nobjects into indistinguishable boxes?\nExample: How many ways can six copies of the same book be\npacked in at most four boxes, if each box can hold up to six\nbooks?\n\nSolution:\n\n6\n5\n\n4\n\n1\n1\n\n3\n\n4\n1\n\n1\n\n3\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n2\n\n3\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nTotal: There are 9 ways to pack 6 identical books into at most 4\nindistinguishable boxes.\n\nThat was ugly...\n\nIs there a better way to do this?\nUnfortunately, no.\n\nHere's why: Placing n indistinguishable objects into k\nindistinguishable boxes is the same as writing n as the sum of at\nmost k positive integers arranged in non-increasing order.\nl i.e., n = a1 + a2 + ... + aj, where a1 \u2265 a2 \u2265 ... \u2265 aj and j \u2264 k\nl We say that a1, a2, ..., aj is a partition of n into j integers\n\nThere is no known simple closed formula for counting the\npartitions of an integer, thus there is no solution for placing n\nindistinguishable items into k indistinguishable boxes.\n\nIn-class exercises\nTop Hat\n\nFinal Thoughts\nn Many counting problems require us to generalize the\nsimple permutation and combination formulas from\nlast time\nn Other problems can be cast as counting the ways to\narrange (in)distinguishable objects into\n(in)distinguishable boxes\nl Problems with indistinguishable boxes are generally more\ndifficult\n\n", "label": [[403, 431, "Concept"], [519, 532, "Concept"], [4400, 4413, "Concept"], [4463, 4476, "Concept"], [293, 321, "Concept"], [2103, 2131, "Concept"], [2619, 2647, "Concept"], [4429, 4442, "Concept"], [4487, 4500, "Concept"], [723, 735, "Concept"], [5306, 5318, "Concept"], [7657, 7669, "Concept"], [5483, 5508, "Concept"], [5523, 5548, "Concept"], [5572, 5597, "Concept"], [6312, 6337, "Concept"], [6629, 6654, "Concept"], [6930, 6955, "Concept"], [10540, 10565, "Concept"], [6249, 6272, "Concept"], [6570, 6593, "Concept"], [6879, 6902, "Concept"], [9945, 9968, "Concept"], [11233, 11256, "Concept"], [6411, 6432, "Concept"], [6596, 6617, "Concept"], [6657, 6678, "Concept"], [7201, 7222, "Concept"], [7550, 7571, "Concept"], [7722, 7743, "Concept"], [8240, 8261, "Concept"], [11266, 11287, "Concept"], [6479, 6502, "Concept"], [6905, 6928, "Concept"], [6958, 6981, "Concept"], [8782, 8805, "Concept"], [9976, 9999, "Concept"], [10126, 10149, "Concept"], [10420, 10443, "Concept"], [10573, 10596, "Concept"], [10986, 11009, "Concept"], [11304, 11327, "Concept"], [10889, 10913, "Concept"]]}
