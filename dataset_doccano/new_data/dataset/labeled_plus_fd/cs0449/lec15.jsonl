\uf04c\n24\n\nParallel Pitfalls\nThis is like that time when a bird pooped on me the same time I stepped in a very\nmuddy puddle.\n\n25\n\nEverybody loves resources\nResource contention:\n\u2022 Printer needs paper...\n\u2022 You need to buy some\npaper...\n\u2022 You need to print an order\nform for paper...\n\u2022 Printer needs paper...\n26\n\nTypically...\n\u2022 Metaphor: intersection.\n\u2022 The intersection is a shared\nresource, much like a device or\nthe CPU.\nIt is fine when two\ntasks can share a\nresource without\nconflict... they do\nnot need to\ncoordinate.\n\n\u2022 Multiplexing the intersection is\nimportant to avoid crashes.\n\u2022 When the streets aren't busy,\ncars just make it safely across.\n27\n\nDeadlock: The traffic jam (it's not very delicious)\n\u2022 However, in some\ncircumstances, several cars\nmay reach the intersection at\nthe same time.\n\nNot fine if tasks\nneed a common\nresource at the\nsame time without\nan agreed way to\nproceed.\n\n\u2022 If there is no previously\ndefined way to handle this,\nthey all wait for the others to\nget out of the way.\n\u25aa Forever.\n\n\u2022 Deadlock occurs when multiple\ntasks are waiting for each\nother, making no progress.\n\n28\n\nSynchronization solves deadlock\n\u2022 Deadlock is a bug that needs\nextra consideration to avoid.\n\u2022 In this case, you need some\nmethod of making only some\nof the cars (tasks) wait, while\nletting others go.\n\nWith synchronization,\n\u25aa Traffic light, perhaps\ntasks can agree which\nget to go next, and\nwhich have to wait. \u2022 Beyond defining order,\n\nsynchronization helps avoid\nthese types of logical errors.\n29\n\nStarved for attention...\n\u2022 Another issue, related to\ndeadlock, is starvation where\nthe system makes progress but\none task is perpetually delayed.\n\n\u2022 When some tasks have priority\nover resources, they may not\ngive them up for other tasks.\n\nWhen nobody yields\nto a particular task\n\u25aa Those tasks wait forever.\nand gives up a shared\nresource, that task\ncannot proceed!\n\u2022 Without a traffic light, you rely\n\non people being nice. :(\n\n30\n\nStarvation: a matter of fairness\n\u2022 This can happen in situations where \"fairness\" scheduling goes awry.\n\u2022 If you have a webserver, the OS might schedule that process whenever\nthere is some incoming requests.\n\u25aa What if you are getting a lot of traffic!\n\u25aa The OS might always schedule the webserver.\n\u25aa Important background tasks might not run!\n\n\u2022 Preventing starvation might be keeping track of how much time a\nprocess has a resource and how long it has waited in line.\n\u25aa Low-priority tasks start at the back of the line and move up the queue the longer\nthey wait... eventually cutting in front of high-priority tasks that start in the front.\n\n\u2022 That's just one idea. Scheduling resources is a very difficult problem!\n\n31\n\nLivelock: The hallway problem\n\u2022 There is a narrow hallway.\n\u2022 Let's say you have two very polite\npeople.\n\u2022 They walk toward each other... and try\nvery hard to get out of each other's way.\n\u25aa They keep insisting the other go ahead of\nthem.\n\n\u2022 This is livelock, where two tasks are\nactively signaling the other to go and\nmaking no progress.\nSpring 2019/2020\n\n32\n\nCareful design works around livelock\n\u2022 Livelock can be solved using a tiebreaking scheme.\n\u25aa Just find something comparable and unique\namong the tasks to create an arbitrary\npriority.\n\n\u2022 All threads have IDs, so one easy\nstrategy is to have the largest ID yield to\nthe smaller.\n\u25aa This also helps starvation since livelock is\nstarvation to the extreme: where everybody\nis starving.\n\n33\n\nDeadlock vs. Livelock\n\u2022 In deadlock, all tasks are waiting for a signal that will never happen.\n\u25aa They are inactively achieving nothing. (\"ZZZZZZZZ\", \"ZZZZZZZZ\")\n\n\u2022 In contrast, livelock occurs when each task signals the other, and they\nrespond by signaling back. (\"No, you.\" \"No... you!\")\n\u25aa They are actively achieving nothing.\n\n\u2022 Detecting that your program has a deadlock or livelock is tricky.\n\u25aa When it does, it may only happen a small percentage of the time.\n\u25aa In your OS course, you will learn more about deadlock detection and resolution.\n\n34\n\nSolving things\n\u2022 Proper synchronization and planning can solve all these issues.\n\u25aa Deadlock: Avoid patterns of critical sections that depend on each other.\n\u25aa Livelock: Establish a tie-breaking mechanism (thread with smallest ID goes first!)\n\u25aa Yet, it takes a good deal of programming experience to handle them.\n\n\u2022 The wide prevalence of multiprocessing and multithreading capable\ncomputers in the hands of average consumers is changing\nprogramming.\n\u25aa New (and old) languages are being pushed for their better handling of\nconcurrency issues.\n\u25aa Best-practices and frameworks continue to adapt to avoid many of the pitfalls\nwe have discussed today.\n\u25aa Pay attention in your compilers and OS course to hone your own skill!\n35\n\nbasic API summary\n\u2022 Thread creation\n\u25aa\n\n\u2022 Join threads (wait until complete)\n\u25aa\n\n\u2022 Getting thread ID\n\nWaits for the given thread to end.\n\nReturns the thread ID of the current thread.\n\n\u25aa\n\n\u2022 Thread destruction (explicit)\n\u25aa\n\u25aa\n\nAttempts to preemptively exit the given thread.\nEnds current thread and returns the provided value.\n\n36\n\nsynchronization API summary\n\u2022 Semaphores\n\u25aa\n\u25aa\nCreates a semaphore with the given initial value.
