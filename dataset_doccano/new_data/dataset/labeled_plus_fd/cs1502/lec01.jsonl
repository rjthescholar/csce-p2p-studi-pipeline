a and b, if a and b are odd, then a \u00d7 b is\nodd.\nAssume that\na and b are integers that are ood.\n\nNeed to Derive:\na \u00d7 b is odd.\n\nFact:\nIf x is an integer that is odd, there exists an integer k such\nthat x = 2k + 1.\n\nSince a and b are odd integers, we can derive:\na = 2i + 1 and b = 2j + 1 for some integers i and j\n\nThumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu\n\nMathematics Preliminaries\n\nProof by Construction\n\nLet a = 2i + 1 and b = 2j + 1, we have\na \u00d7 b = (2i + 1) \u00d7 (2j + 1)\n= 4ij + 2i + 2j + 1\n= 2(2ij + i + j) + 1\nThus, a \u00d7 b is an odd integer since there exists an integer\nk = 2ij + i + j such that a \u00d7 b = 2k + 1.\nNote: By showing a couple of test cases is not a proof\nIn the above proof, we assume that a and b can be any odd\nintegers\n\nThumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu\n\nMathematics Preliminaries\n\nProof by Contradiction\n\nConsider the statement \u00acP \u2192 False\nSuppose we can show that \u00acP \u2192 False is true\nRecall that T \u2192 F = F and F \u2192 F = T\nSince \u00acP \u2192 F is true, \u00acP must be false\nIn other words, P is true.\n\nThus, to show that the statement P is True, we need to show\nthat the statement \u00acP \u2192 False is true.\nFrom previous example, we need to assume that \u00acP is true (or\nP is false) and try to derive a false statement\nA false statement is a statement that contradict with an\ninitial assumption, a hypotheses, a statement that have been\nderived previously, or another generally accepted fact.\n\nThumrongsak Kosiyatrakul

an even number.\nSince p2 is an even number, p is an even number\nSince p is an even number, p = 2r for some integer r\nKeep deriving:\np2 = 2q 2\n(2r)2 = 2q 2\n4r2 = 2q 2\n2r2 = q 2\nSince q 2 = 2r2 , q 2 is an even number\nSince q 2 is an even number, q is an even number\n\nThumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu\n\nMathematics Preliminaries\n\nProof by Contradiction\n\np \u221a\n= 2 for some positive integers p\nq\nand q with no common factor greater than 1\n\u221a\nBut we show that if 2 is a rational number both p and q are\neven\nEarlier we stated that\n\nTherefore p and q have a
