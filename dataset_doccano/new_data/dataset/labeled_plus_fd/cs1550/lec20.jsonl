Thank you so much\n\u2022 why again will there be multiple memory accesses\nusing a TLB?\n\u2022 Two level page tables and how they are better than\nsingle page tables (take up less space)\n\u2022 Where are the second and third level page tables\nstored? Are they paged in and out of memory like a\nnormal page?\n\u2022 when will we get our midterm grades\nCS 1550 - Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n4\n\nHow big should a page be?\n\u25fc\n\nSmaller pages have advantages\nLess internal fragmentation\n\u25fc Better fit for various data structures, code sections\n\u25fc Less unused physical memory (some pages have 20\nuseful bytes and the rest isn't needed currently)\n\u25fc\n\n\u25fc\n\nLarger pages are better because\n\u25fc\n\nLess overhead to keep track of them\nSmaller page tables\n\u25fc TLB can point to more memory (same number of pages, but\nmore memory per page)\n\u25fc Faster paging algorithms (fewer table entries to look\nthrough)\n\u25fc\n\n\u25fc\n\nMore efficient to transfer larger pages to and from disk\nCS 1550 - Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n5\n\nSharing Pages\n\nCS 1550 - Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n6\n\nSharing pages\n\u25fc\n\nProcesses can share pages\nEntries in page tables point to the same physical page\nframe\n\u25fc Easier to do with code: no problems with modification\n\u25fc\n\n\u25fc\n\nVirtual addresses in different processes can be...\nThe same: easier to exchange pointers, keep data\nstructures consistent\n\u25fc Different: may be easier to actually implement\n\u25fc\n\nNot a problem if there are only a few shared regions\n\u25fc Can be very difficult if many processes share regions with\neach other\n\u25fc\n\nCS 1550 -

Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n10\n\nPage locking\n\nCS 1550 - Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n11\n\nLocking pages in memory\nVirtual memory and I/O occasionally interact\n\u25fc P1 issues call for read from device into\nbuffer\n\u25fc\n\nWhile it's waiting for I/O, P2 runs\n\u25fc P2 has a page fault\n\u25fc P1's I/O buffer might be chosen to be paged out\n\u25fc\n\n\u25fc\n\n\u25fc\n\nThis can create a problem because an I/O device is\ngoing to write to the buffer on P1's behalf\n\nSolution: allow some pages to be locked into\nmemory\nLocked pages are immune from being replaced\n\u25fc Pages only stay locked for (relatively) short\nperiods\n\u25fc\n\nCS 1550 - Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n12\n\nMap of MMU, TLB, Page Table, etc.\n\nCS 1550 - Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n13\n\nWhen are dirty pages written to disk?\n\u25fc\n\nOn demand (when they're replaced)\nFewest writes to disk\n\u25fc Slower: replacement takes twice as long (must wait for\ndisk write and disk read)\n\u25fc\n\n\u25fc\n\nPeriodically (in the background)\n\u25fc\n\n\u25fc\n\nBackground process scans through page tables, writes\nout dirty pages that are pretty old\n\nBackground process also keeps a list of pages\nready for replacement\nPage faults handled faster: no need to find space on\ndemand\n\u25fc Cleaner may use the same structures discussed\nearlier (clock, etc.)\n\u25fc\n\nCS 1550 -
