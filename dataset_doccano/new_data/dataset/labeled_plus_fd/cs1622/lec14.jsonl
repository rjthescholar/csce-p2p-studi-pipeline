And? How does that help?\n\u25cf well... we can map that imaginary stack onto the registers.\ng = a + b;\n\ns1\n\n=\n\ns0\ng\n\na\n\ns0\n\nb\na\n\ns0\n\na + b\n\n+\na\n\nb\n\nthis tells us what register to put each value into!\n\nlw\nlw\nadd\nsw\n\ns0, 0(fp) # a\ns1, 4(fp) # b\ns0, s0, s1\ns0, g\n\nbut now we come to an important issue: to be allowed to use the\nsaved registers, we must save the caller's versions of them.\n14\n\nThe last piece of the calling convention\n\u25cf only after we have generated the code for a function, do we know\nhow many saved registers it needs.\n\u25cf so there is one more part of the stack frame:\ny\n\nx\n\nfp\n\nfp\nra\n\nin the prologue, we will have to store each of\nthese saved registers to the stack...\n\n...and in the epilogue, we will load them back.\n\ni\n\nz\ns1\ns0\n\nwe have to save the caller's values of any\nsaved registers this function uses.\n\nsp\n\nthis is how the saved register contract works.\nI taught it in 447 and it's just as relevant now.\n15\n\nSome last register allocation thoughts\n\u25cf can we use t registers at all?\no sure, as long as we can prove that there are no function calls\nfrom the time we put a value in it to the time we use that value.\no that might be pretty simple: look at the AST \"to the right\" and if\nthere are no \"function call\" nodes, we can use a t register instead.\no this is more complicated, but it will use fewer (or no) s registers,\nmeaning less time/space spent saving/restoring them.\n\u25cf there are only 8 saved registers (s0 .. s7). what if we need more?\no uhh \ud83d\udca6\no well, this register allocation scheme will work for simple code.\no we'll talk about a much more sophisticated algorithm at the end\nof the course, which will solve this problem (and others, like using\na registers for arguments instead of the stack).\n16\n\nControl flow statements\n\u25cf assuming we've got expressions worked out, another surprisingly\ntricky bit is control flow statements: conditionals and loops.\no specifically, the conditions for these statements can be hard to\ngenerate good code for. (but that's not a primary goal here.)\nif i < 10 {\n...\n}\n\nlw\nbge\n...\n_end:\n\ns0, -16(fp)\ns0, 10, _end\n\ngetting the condition that simple is hard to\ndo; we might do something like this instead:\nlw\nli\nslt\nbeq\n...\n_end:\n\ns0, -16(fp)\ns1, 10\ns0, s0, s1\ns0, zero, _end\n\n17\n\nLazy operators (\"short-circuiting\")\n\u25cf recall that like in most languages, logical and and or will only\nevaluate their rhs if they have to - making their codegen very\ndifferent from the other operators.\nif i < 10 or i > 20 {\n...\n}\nsee how it skips right to the code\nwhen the first condition is true?\n\nlw\ns0, -16(fp)\nli\ns1, 10\nslt s0, s0, s1\nbne s0, zero, _true\nlw\ns0, -16(fp)\nli\ns1, 20\nsgt s0, s0, s1\nbeq s0, zero, _end\n_true:\n...\n_end:\n\n18\n\nYou can assign comparison operators into variables\n\u25cf it seems like no one teaches you this but this is totally valid code in\nJava (and in lots of other languages too):\nboolean b = x < 10;\nboolean d = i < 10 || i > 20;\n\u25cf because of this, you may not be able to use the same codegen\nalgorithm for e.g. logical OR in all cases!\no you still have to do the short-circuiting...\no but now you're producing a value to be put into a variable\no which, depending on how your codegen works, could be a very\ndifferent thing from \"writing a condition for a loop\"\n\n19\n\nArrays\n\n20\n\nAdding features is FunTM\n\u25cf okay. now let's assume we've implemented lexing, parsing, semantic\nanalysis, and codegen for all the basic features of our language:\no variables, functions, ints, bools, strings. just the simple stuff.\n\u25cf let's now think about how we'd go about adding a new feature to\nthe language, from design all the way through to codegen.\no and along the way, this might give you an appreciation for how\nparts of the language interact with one another.\n\u25cf we'll be adding arrays, which will work very similarly to how they do\nin Java, but with some slightly different syntax.\n\n21\n\nMinimum Viable Product\n\u25cf a good place to start is by writing some code to get a feel for how\nwe want this feature to look and work.\n\u25cf let's focus on the absolute core features of arrays: allocating them,\naccessing their items, and getting their length.\nlet a = new [int; 10];\n\nthis syntax might look a bit odd, but it's meant to echo a similar\nsyntax used in Rust. it's also easier to parse than new int[10].\na[0] = 5;\n\nI think it's clear what's happening here.\nfor i in 0, a.length { println_i(a[i]); }\n\nand this is familiar too!\n22\n\nLexing and Parsing\n\u25cf for lexing, we only need to add two tokens to our lexer: [ and ].\n\u25cf for parsing, we've got a few new rules to add.\nnew [int; 10]\n\nNew:\n'new' (StructNew | ArrayNew)\nStructNew: Id '(' ')'\nArrayCtor: '[' Type ';' Exp ']'\n\na[0] = 5;\n\nPostfixOp: FuncCall | Field | Index\nIndex:\n'[' Exp ']'\n\none more important rule: we have to be able to write array\ntypes, for things like function arguments and struct fields.\nType:\n\nfn f(a: [int])\nArrayType:\n\nVoidType | 'bool' | 'int' |\n'string' | FuncType |\nStructType | ArrayType\n'[' Type ']'\n\n23\n\nSemantic analysis: typing rules\n\u25cf arrays don't interact with the naming rules at all, so let's skip to types.\nnew [T; n]\n\na[i]\n\na.length\n\n\u25aa n must be int\n\u25aa the type of the whole expression is [T]\n\u25aa a must be [T]\n\u25aa i must be int\n\u25aa the type of the whole expression is T\n\u25aa if a is [T]:\n\u25aa the only allowed field is length\n\u25aa the type of the whole expression is int\n\u25aa and this cannot be the lhs of =\n24\n\nMore semantics: evaluation rules\n\u25cf these explain what the code does, which can also require runtime\nerror checking.\nnew [T; n]\n\na[i]\n\na.length\n\n\u25aa dynamically allocates an array on the heap.\n\u25aa n must be >= 0.\n\u25aa if not, the program halts with an error.\n\u25aa gets the ith item in a, zero-based.\n\u25aa a is evaluated before i.\n\u25aa i must be >= 0 and < a.length.\n\u25aa if not, the program halts with an error.\n\u25aa gets the length of a.\n25\n\nRuntime representation: data\n\u25cf as you hopefully learned in 447, an array is represented in memory by\nplacing its items next to each other, equidistantly spaced.\n\u25cf consider an array of 3 ints which are 32 bits (4 Bytes) each:\n\nA[0]\nbyte offset:\n\n0\n\nA[1]\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nA[2]\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10 11\n\ngiven a pointer A that points to the beginning of the\narray, we can get the ith item with the formula A + S\u00b7i,\nwhere S is the size of one item.\n\nhere, S = 4, so A + 4\u00b7i gives us the byte offset of item i.\n26\n\nRuntime representation: length\n\u25cf each array also has to remember its length, because there's\nnothing to tell you where \"the end of the array\" is.\nlet a = new [int; 3];\n3\n\nthe length comes first\nand takes up 4 bytes.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nso now our item access formula must be\noffset by 4 to skip the length: A + S\u00b7i + 4\n(different types use different values of S, so\nwe can't do A + S(i + 1) in general.)\n\nnow we have all we need to be able to implement\na[i] and a.length! but what about new[int; 3]?\n27\n\nRuntime library: allocating arrays\n\u25cf dynamic memory allocation is something the runtime library is\nresponsible for. so, we'll need a function to allocate arrays.\n\u25cf fn rt$new_array(item_size: int, len: int)\no this will allocate an array of len items, where each item is\nitem_size bytes; zero out the data; set its length field to len;\nand return a pointer to it.\no it will also crash the program if len is negative, as per the\nevaluation semantics.\n\u25cf the code generation will turn array allocations into calls to this\nfunction, using a constant for item_size based on the type.\no e.g. for an array of bool, item_size is 1; for int it's 4; etc.\n\n28\n\nCodegen\n\u25cf finally, code generation is fairly straightforward.\nnew [T; n]\na.length\na[i]\n\ngenerated as a call to rt$new_array(S, n)\nload an int from the memory a points to\nfirst, crash if i is negative or >= a.length. if not,\ncalculate address as a + Si + 4; then load/store\n\nand we're done! yay, our language has arrays now!\n\n29\n\nOr does it?\n\u25cf this is just the minimum viable version of this feature.\n\u25cf what about things like:\no array initializers/literals, for allocating and filling in arrays at the\nsame time like in Java: int[] a = new int[]{ 1, 2, 3 };\no better multi-dimensional array initialization, again like Java:\nint[][] a = new int[10][20];\n\u25aa remember, this is an array of arrays: each item in the outer array\n(the 10 dimension) is a reference to an array of 20 ints\no standard library functions for sorting, searching, filling,\nmodifying arrays?\n\u25cf such a simple-seeming feature, and yet so many things to consider...\no but think about how each of these might be implemented on top\nof the basic features we talked about here.\n30\n\n", "label": [[96, 114, "Concept"], [4508, 4526, "Concept"], [119, 125, "Concept"], [146, 152,
