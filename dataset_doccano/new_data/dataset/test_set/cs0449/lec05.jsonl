This is an address on the stack.\nStack deallocation (oh no!)\n\n\u2022 This may work sometimes.\n\n\u2022 However calling a new function will overwrite the array. Don't trust it!!\n\n\u2022 Instead: Allocate on the heap and pass in a buffer. (next slide)\n27\n\nAppropriate use of arrays. Approp-array-te.\nArrays don't store length. Gotta pass it in.\nPointers allow for passing arguments \"by reference\"\n\nPointers can indeed be array-like!\n\nHeap allocation!\nAlthough we overwrite all values, using calloc to\ninitialize array elements to 0 reduces surprises.\nQ: What happens if we pass 20 instead of 10 to powers_of_two?\n\n28\n\nQuick notes on function arguments, here...\n\u2022 All arguments are passed \"by value\" in C.\n\u2022 This means the values are copied into temporary space (the stack, usually)\nwhen the functions are called.\n\u2022 This means changing those values does not change their original sources.\n\n\u2022 However, we can pass \"by reference\" indirectly using pointers:\n\u2022 Similar to how you pass \"by reference\" in Java by using arrays.\nThe \"value\" of the argument is the address.\n\n29\n\nCareful! No guard rails... You might run off the edge...\n\u2022 Since arrays are just pointers... and the length is not known...\n\u2022 Accessing any element is correct regardless of actual intended length!\n\u2022 No array bounds checking is the source of many very serious bugs!\n\u2022 Can pull out and leak arbitrary memory.\n\u2022 Can potentially cause the program to execute arbitrarily code.\n\nWhat if this is too big?\n\nA simple mistake, but it will gleefully write to it!\n\n30\n\nPointer arithmetic (Warning: it's wacky)\n\u2022 Because pointers and arrays are essentially the same concept in C...\n\u2022 Pointers have some strange interactions with math operations.\n\n\u2022 Ideally pointers should \"align\" to their values in memory.\n\u2022 Goal: Incrementing an\npointer should go to the next\n\u2022 That is, not part way between two\nvalues.\n\nin memory.\n\n\u2022 Therefore, pointer sum is scaled to the element size.\n\u2022 Multiplication and other operators are undefined and result in a compiler\nerror.\n\n31\n\nPointer arithmetic in practice:\nAlternative (and less common) way of expressing a pointer.\n\nThe\n(postfix-increment) happens AFTER the dereference.\nThis is defined by the C language and is really confusing in practice.\n(but you'll see it. often.)\n\n32\n\nThe C Memory Model: The Heap\n\u2022 The Heap is the dynamic data section!\n\u2022 You interact with the heap entirely with pointers.\n\u2022\nreturns the address to the heap with at least the\nnumber of bytes requested. Or\non error.\n\nPotential Layout\n(32-bit addresses)\n\nstack\ncurrently unused but\navailable memory\n\nheap\nstatic data\n\ncode\n33\n\nStrings\nNo longer just for cats!\n\n34\n\nStrings\n\u2022 They are arrays and, as such, inherit all their limitations/issues.\n\u2022 The size is not stored.\n\u2022 They are essentially just pointers to memory.\n\n\u2022 Text is represented as an array of\n\nelements.\n\n\u2022 Representing text is hard!!!\n\u2022 Understatement of the dang century.\n\u2022 Original ASCII is 7-bit, encodes Latin and Greek\n\u2022 Hence\n\nbeing the C integer byte type.\n\n\u2022 Extended for various locales haphazardly.\n\u2022 7-bits woefully inadequate for certain languages.\n\n\u2022 Unicode mostly successfully unifies a variety of glyphs.\n\u2022 Tens of thousands of different characters! More than a byte!!\n\n35\n\nHow long is your string?\n\u2022 Arrays in C are just pointers and as such do not store their length.\n\u2022 They are simply continuous sections of memory!\n\u2022 Up to you to figure out how long it is!\n\u2022 Misreporting or assuming length is often a big source of bugs!\n\n\u2022 So, there are two common ways of expressing length:\n\u2022 Storing the length alongside the array.\n\u2022 Storing a special value within the array to mark the end. (A sentinel\nvalue)\n\n\u2022 Strings in C commonly employ a sentinel value.\n\u2022 Such a value must be something considered invalid for actual data.\n\u2022 How do you know how long such an array is?\n\u2022 You will have to search for the sentinel value! Incurring a O(n) time cost.\n\n36\n\nThe string literal.\n\u2022 String literals should be familiar from Java.\n\u2022 However, in C, they are\npointers. (That is:\n)\n\u2022 The contents of the literal are read-only (immutable) so it is a:\n\u2022 Modifying it crashes your program!!\n\u2022 A pointer that can't change pointing to an immutable string is a\n\nLet's ignore this! \u263a\n(for now)\n\nThe variable is allocated on the stack,\nwhich is a pointer. The string itself is\n37\nlikely in the static data segment!\n\nHow long is your string? Let's find out.\n\u2022 The\n\nstandard library function reports the length of a string.\n\n\u2022 This is done in roughly O(n) time as it must find the sentinel.\n\u2022 The following code investigates and prints out the sentinel:\n\n38\n\nWhen good strings go bad.\n\u2022 What happens if that sentinel... was not there?\n\u2022 Well... it would keep counting garbage memory until it sees a 0.\n\nThis syntax copies the string literal on to the stack.\nThis allows us to modify it. (otherwise, it is immutable)\n\nThe length here depends on the state of memory in the stack.\n\n39\n\nUsing stronger strings. A... rope... perhaps.\n\u2022 To ensure that malicious input is less likely to be disastrous...\n\u2022 We have alternative standard functions that set a maximum length.\n\nstrnlen will stop after the 12th character if it does not see a sentinel.\n\n40\n\nComparing \"Apples\" to \"Oranges\"\n\u2022 When you compare strings using\n\nit compares the addresses!\n\n\u2022 Since string literals are constant, they only exist in the executable once.\n\u2022 All references will refer to the same string!\n\n41\n\nComparing \"Apples\" to \"Oranges\"\n\u2022 When the addresses differ, they are not equal.\n\u2022 So, you have to be careful when comparing them.\n\u2022 This is similar to Java when considering\nversus\n\n42\n\nComparing \"Apples\" to \"Oranges\"\n\u2022 To compare values instead, use the standard library's\n\n.\n\n\u2022 This will perform a byte-by-byte comparison of the string.\n\u2022 Upon finding a difference, it returns rough difference between those contrary bytes.\n\u2022 When they are the same, then the difference is 0!\n\n\u2022 Therefore, it is case sensitive! It also has a O n time complexity.\n\nwill return 0 when the strings\nare equal.\n\n43\n\nAppropriate string construction. A-rope-riate.\n\u2022 C is a very deliberate language.\nis important here!
