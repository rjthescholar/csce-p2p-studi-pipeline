(Faster)\n\n\u2022 Those small pieces can come from others. Code reuse!\n\u2022 We can share executable code among many running programs. (Shared Libraries)\n\n9\n\nWhat is inside that box?\n\u2022 To understand what linkers do, we\nneed to see what an executable is\nmade out of.\n(Spoilers: it is not just code/data)\n\u2022 A Linux executable is defined by\nthe Executable and Linkable\nFormat (ELF) standard.\n\u2022 Used for\nfiles\n\u2022 And executables\n\u2022 And\n(shared objects; soon!)\n10\n\nObject File Format\n1. object file header: size and position of the other pieces of the object\nfile\n2. text segment: the machine code\n3. data segment: data in the source file (binary)\n4. relocation table: identifies lines of code that need to be \"handled\"\n5. symbol table: list of this file's labels and data that can be referenced\n6. debugging information\n\u2022 A standard format is ELF (except MS)\n\u2022 http://www.skyfree.org/linux/references/ELF_Format.pdf\n\nObject File Information Tables\n\u2022 Symbol Table holds list of \"items\" that may be used by other files\n\u2022 Non-local labels - function names for call\n\u2022 Static Data - variables & literals that might be accessed across files\n\n\u2022 Relocation Table holds list of \"items\" that this file needs the address of later\n(currently undetermined)\n\u2022 Any label or piece of static data referenced in an instruction in this file\n\u2022 Both internal and external\n\n\u2022 Each file has its own symbol and relocation tables\n\n12\n\nWhat the ELF ??\n\u2022 Contains all of the segments and data sections defining a program.\n\u2022 The ELF executable has roughly the following structure:\nOffset\n\nName\n\nDescription\n\nMagic Number\n\n4 bytes: A\n\nClass\n\n1 byte:\n\nif 32-bit, 0x2 if 64-bit\n\nData\n\n1 byte:\n\nif little-endian, 0x2 if big-endian\n\nVersion\n\n1 byte:\n\nfor the current version.\n\nABI\n\n1 byte:\n\nfor System V (our C ABI)\n\nMachine\n\n2 bytes:\n\nbyte followed by \"\n\nis x86,\n\nis MIPS,\n\n\" in ASCII\n\nis RISC-V, etc\n\n13\n\nWhat the ELF ??\n\u2022 The remaining fields indicate where certain sections start.\n\u2022 An ELF executable contains these sections:\n\u2022 Segment Headers (where .text, .data, .bss, etc, exist in the executable)\n\u2022 The initial data for each memory segment in the memory layout!\n\u2022 We will look at these again when we look at loading.\n\n\u2022 The Symbol Table\n\u2022 All of the \"names\" that may be referenced by other code.\n\n\u2022 Symbols can consist of:\n\u2022 Functions\n\u2022 Global variables\n\u2022 Special sections (special compiler or OS areas)\n\n\u2022 We will focus on function/variable symbols.\n14\n\n- Viewing the symbol table\n\u2022 You can investigate the symbols that are part of any object file\nusing the\ncommand on Linux/UNIX.\nC(\n\n)\n\nThis is a symbol. It has a location.\n\nHere it is! At 0x27 (39) bytes.\n\n15\n\n; Controlling the symbols\n\u2022 Remember the\n\nkeyword?\n\n\u2022 This forces any symbol to be local to the current file. That is, it can\nnot be referenced by an outside function.\n\u2022 This is because the symbol will not be included in the symbol table!\n\u2022 The linker will not be able to see it.\n\n\u2022 This is useful for avoiding name collisions, when two functions have\nthe same name.\n\u2022 This normally would make using multiple files and other people's code\ntroublesome.\n\u2022 Using\nhelps because it will not pollute the symbol table.\n16\n\nControlled the symbols\n\u2022 You can investigate the impact of using\ncommand on Linux/UNIX.\nC(\n\nby again using the\n\n)\nThis symbol has a location... but it can\nonly be referenced in this file.\n\nOur static function is now \"LOCAL\"\n\n17\n\n; when you used to be an intern\n\u2022 The other side of the coin is the\nkeyword.\n\u2022 This tells the linker that it should expect the symbol to be found\nelsewhere.\nC(\n\n)\n\nC(\n\n)\n\nHere it is!!\n\nThis symbol is... somewhere.\n\n18\n\nFinal thoughts of global variables\n\u2022 You should always avoid global variables.\n\u2022 However, if you are using them, make sure to liberally use\n\u2022 This will stop the names of variables from polluting the symbol table.\n\u2022 The use of\nis likely indicating a poor design.\n\n\u2022 This is also true for functions, too.\n\u2022 Generally declare them\nunless you need\nthem from within another file.\n\u2022 Helps make it clear what functions are important\nand which can be deleted or refactored.\n\u2022 (Much like private functions in classes)\n\n\u2022 Always initialize your global variables!\n\n19\n\nSeeing through the linker's eyes\n\u2022 Which symbols are part of each file?\n\u2022 Which are local and which are global?\n\u2022 Which symbols are satisfied by the other file?\nC(\n\n)\n\nA local symbol.\n\nA global symbol.\n\nReferenced here.\n\nC(\n\n)\n\nThe linker references\n\"main\" when it compiles\nthe executable.\n\nWe need to tell the compiler\nthat we are linking to a symbol.\n\nA global symbol.\nLinker doesn't see these\ntemporary variables.\n\nReferenced here.\n\n20\n\nSumming it up: Playing mad-libs\n\nfibonacci.c\n\nfibonacci.o\n\nfibonacci\n\n0x007c0e10\n???\n\nmain.c\n\n\u2022 The compiler hands\noff object files with\nblanks where\nreferenced symbols\nreside.\n\u2022 The linker's job is to\nfill in those blanks\nwith the location of\nthe symbol in the\nfinal executable.\n\nmain.o\n21\n\nStatic Libraries (\n\nfiles)\n\u2022 If you want to share\nyour library with\nothers...\n\nutil.c\n\ntree.c\n\nutil.o\n\ntree.o\n\nmy-lib.a\n\n\u2022 Instead of creating an\nexecutable, you can\npackage together all of\nthe\nfiles into a\nsingle archive (\nfile)\n\u2022 You can use the\nprogram on Linux for\nthis.\n22\n\nCompilation: Simple Overview - Redux\n\u2022 We can use my-lib.a in\nplace of the object files\nwe need.\n\nhello.c\n\nutil.c\nCS/COE 0449 - Spring 2019/2020\n\nhello.o\n\nutil.o\n\nhello\n\nmy-lib.a\nExternal Libraries\n\n\u2022 The\nfile is just a\ncontainer for a set of\nobject files. Essentially,\nit is just a kind of zip\nfile of object files.\n\u2022 These object files get\ncopied into our\nexecutable... not very\nefficient! Hmm!\n23\n\nLoaders\nYou should always stretch before you run - OSes do this, too.\n\n24\n\nThe Operating System\n\u2022 How does your ELF executable actually\nrun?\n\u2022 There needs to be some system software\nto unpack the executable into memory.\n\n\u2022 That system software is a loader and it is\npart of an operating system.\n\n25\n\nMemory Segments - Deeper dive!\n\u2022 The ELF executable defines several segments:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n- The code segment (machine code)\n- The data segment (program data)\n- The read-only data segment (constants)\n- Uninitialized data segment (\"zero\" data)\n\n\u2022 The\nsegment is a special segment for all data\nthat starts as\nor\n.\n\u2022 (Its name is Block Started by Symbol which is a historic\nname.)\n\u2022 It is often an optimization: the executable does not need to\nstore a whole bunch of zeros.\n\u2022 Hmm... the operating system must then allocate a bunch of\nzeros. Is that fast?? (We'll get there)\n\nKernel Memory\nstack\ncurrently unused but\navailable memory\n\nheap\n.bss\n.data\n\n.text\n26\n\nRunning a program\n1.

However, let's make it more flexible.\n\u2022 Our linking so far is static linking where all of the code goes into\nthe executable. Duplicate code from static libraries is copied in.\n\u2022 Not very space efficient. Duplicates code most programs are using! (libc)\n\u2022 What if we \"shared\" the code external to the executable?\n\n\u2022 For dynamic linking we will think about loading not just the\nexecutable, but library code as well. A shared library.\n\u2022 The OS loader must load the program into memory and also take on the\ntask of loading library code.\n\u2022 It then must do the \"mad-libs\" replacing references in the program to\npoint to where in memory the library code was loaded. Tricky!\n29\n\nDynamic Linking\nLinking but... yanno... animated.\n\n30\n\nCode that can be loaded... anywhere?\n\u2022 The main problem is this:\n\u2022 Programs generally need to assume where in\nmemory they live.\n\n\u2022 They refer to functions and data at particular\naddresses.\n\u2022 The linker decides where those are, but they are\nthen hard-coded in.\nWhere should this go??\n\n\u2022 We want to provide a single software library\nto multiple executables...\n\u2022 We can't know ahead of time where that library\ncan go in memory since programs are different\nsizes... they might need multiple libraries... etc.\nCS/COE 0449 - Spring 2019/2020\n\nKernel Memory\nstack\nlibz.so .data\nlibz.so .text\n\n.bss\n.data\n\n.text\n31\n\nSolution: relocatable code\n\u2022 Let's allow code to refer to functions and/or data that may move.\n\u2022 Essentially, the operating system plays the mad-lib game.\n\u2022 The ELF executable has a list of \"relocatable entries\"\n\u2022 The OS goes through them and fills them in according to where the external\nsymbols are.\nLinking to the libz.so dynamic library\n\nC(\n\n)\n\nWe don't know where this function ultimately is...\n\n32\n\nSolution: relocatable code\n\u2022 Let's allow code to refer to functions and/or data that may move.\n\u2022 Essentially, the operating system plays the mad-lib game.\n\u2022 The ELF executable has a list of \"relocatable entries\"\n\u2022 The OS goes through them and fills them in according to where the external symbols are.\nC(\n\n)\n\nx86-64 (\n\n)\n\n33\n\nSolution: relocatable code: Loading\n\u2022 When the OS loads this executable... it will have a relocation entry that tells\nit to overwrite at byte\nthe relative address of \"compressBound\"\n\u2022 With this extra step, the OS loader is also providing dynamic linking.\nC(\n\n)\n\nx86-64 (\n\n)\n\n0x114b + 0x5fe = 0x1749\n(\nis relative to\n)\nIn modern times, this makes use of a jump table\ncalled\nProcedure\nLinkage Table (PLT).\nCS/COEa\n0449\n- Spring 2019/2020\n\n34\n\nTaking a PIC, eating some PIE - Avoiding relocations\n\u2022 In order to allow code to be resident\nanywhere in memory, the compiler must\nemit machine code that always uses\nrelative addresses!\n\n\u2022 This is called position independent\ncode (or PIC).\n\u2022 When your entire executable is made\nout of PIC, it is a position independent\nexecutable (or PIE)\n\u2022\n\nwill compile code this way when\nyou specify the\nflag.\n\nWho doesn't like pie???\n\n\u2022 You generally need this when creating\ndynamic libraries.\n\n35\n\nRunning a program - Redux\n1.
