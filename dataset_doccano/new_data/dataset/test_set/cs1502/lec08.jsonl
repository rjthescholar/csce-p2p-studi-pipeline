Since C is regular, the Pumping lemma says that for any\nstring s \u2208 C of length at least p, s can be divided into s = xyz satisfying the following\nconditions:\n1\n\nxy i z \u2208 C for any i \u2265 0\n\n2\n\n|y| > 0\n\n3\n\n|xy| \u2264 p\n\nLet s = 0p 1p . Since s starts with p 0s, to satisfy the third condition, x and y are\nstrings that contain nothing but 0s. In other words, x = 0j for any j \u2265 0, and y = 0k\nfor any k > 0. Note that k must be greater than 0 because |y| = |0k | = k, and the\ncondition 2 says that |y| > 0. Since x = 0j and y = 0k , z = 0p-(j+k) 1p . Let i = 2.\nWe have\nxy i z = xy 2 z\n= xyyz\n= 0j 0k 0k 0p-(j+k) 1p\n= 0p+k 1p\nFor the string 0p+k 1p to be in C, the number of 0s must be equal to the number of\n1s. In other words, p + k must be equal to p. This requires k to be 0. But since k\nmust be greater than 0, xy 2 z 6\u2208 B - contradiction.

Since D is regular, the Pumping lemma says that for any\nstring s \u2208 D of length at least p, s can be divided into s = xyz satisfying the\nfollowing conditions:\n1 xy i z \u2208 D for any i \u2265 0\n2 |y| > 0\n3 |xy| \u2264 p\nLet s = 1p 0p+1 . Since s starts with p 1s, to satisfy the third condition, x and y are\nstrings that contain nothing but 1s. In other words, x = 1j for any j \u2265 0, and y = 1k\nfor any k > 0. Note that k must be greater than 0 because |y| = |1k | = k, and the\ncondition 2 says that |y| > 0. Since x = 1j and y = 1k , z = 1p-(j+k) 0p+1 . Let\ni = 2. We have\nxy i z = xy 2 z = xyyz\n= 1j 1k 1k 1p-(j+k) 0p+1\n= 1p+k 0p+1\nFor the string 1p+k 0p+1 to be in D, the number of 0s must be greater than the\nnumber of 1s. In other words, p + 1 must be greater than p + k. This requires k to be\n0. But since k must be greater than 0, xy 2 z 6\u2208 D - contradiction.
