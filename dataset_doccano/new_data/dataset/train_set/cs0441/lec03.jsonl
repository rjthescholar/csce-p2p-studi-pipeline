If an agent\nis having a bad day, he or she will always lie to you. If\nan agent is having a good day, he or she will always\ntell you the truth. Alice tells you that Bob is having a\nbad day.

If an agent is having a\nbad day, he or she will always lie to you. If an agent is having a\ngood day, he or she will always tell you the truth. Alice tells you\nthat Bob is having a bad day. Bob tells you that he and Alice are\nboth having the same type of day. Can you trust the advice you\nreceive from Alice during your call?\n\nStep 1: Identify the rules of the puzzle\nl Good day = tell the truth\nl Bad day = lie!\n\nStep 2: Assign propositions to the key concepts in the puzzle\nl a o \"Alice is having a good day\"\nl b o \"Bob is having a good day\"\n\nStep 3: Make assumptions and reason logically\n\nAnother example\nConsider a group of friends: Frank, Anna, and Chris. If\nFrank is not the oldest, then Anna is. If Anna is not the\nyoungest, then Chris is the oldest. Determine the\nrelative ages of Frank, Anna, and Chris.\nPropositions:\nl\nl\nl\nl\n\nf = \"Frank is the oldest\"\na = \"Anna is the oldest\"\na' = \"Anna is the youngest\"\nc = \"Chris is the oldest\"\n\nRules:\n1. \u00acf \u00ae a\n2. \u00aca' \u00ae c\n\nStep 3: Make assumptions and reason logically\n\nSometimes no solution is a solution!\nAlice and Bob are technical support agents. Alice says\n\"I am having a good day.\" Bob says \"I am having a good\nday.\" Can you trust either Alice or Bob?\n\nStep 1: Identify rules\nl Good day = tell the truth\nl Bad day = lie\n\nStep 2: Assign propositions\nl a = Alice is having a good day\nl b = Bob is having a good day\n\nStep 3: Make assumptions and reason logically\n\nIn-class exercises\nProblem 1: Alice and Bob are technical support agents\nworking to fix your computer. Alice tells you that Bob\nis having a bad day today and that you should expect a\nlong wait before your computer is fixed. Bob tells you\nnot to worry, Alice is just having a bad day-your\ncomputer will be ready in no time.\n\nQuestion: Can you draw any conclusions about when\nyour computer will be fixed?
