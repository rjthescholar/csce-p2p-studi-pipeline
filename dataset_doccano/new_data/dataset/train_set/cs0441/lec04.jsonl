What are the truth values of the\nfollowing expressions:\nl P(0)\nfalse\nl P(23)\ntrue\nl P(-42)\nfalse\nWe can express the prime number property using\npredicate logic:\nl P(x) o \"x is prime\"\nl D(x) o \"x has no divisors other than 1 and itself\"\nl P(x) \u00ab D(x)\n\nPredicates can also be defined on more than one\nvariable\nLet P(x, y) o x + y = 42. What are the truth values of\nthe following expressions:\nl P(45, -3)\ntrue\nl P(23, 23)\nfalse\nl P(1, 119)\nfalse\nLet S(x, y, z) o x + y = z. What are the truth values of\nthe following expressions:\ntrue\nl S(1, 1, 2)\nfalse\nl S(23, 24, 42)\ntrue\nl S(-9, 18, 9)\n\nPredicates play a central role in program control\nflow and debugging\nIf/then statements:\nl if x > 17 then y = 13\n\nLoops:\nl while y <= 14 do\n...\nend while\n\nDebugging in C/C++:\nl assert(strlen(passwd) > 0);\n\nThis is a predicate!\n\nQuantifiers allow us to make general statements that\nturn propositional functions into propositions\nIn English, we use quantifiers on a regular basis:\nl All students can ride the bus for free\nl Many people like chocolate\nl I enjoy some types of tea\nl At least one person will sleep through their final exam\n\nQuantifiers require us to define a universe of discourse\n(also called a domain) in order for the quantification\nto make sense\nl \"Many like chocolate\" doesn't make sense!\n\nWhat are the universes of discourse for the above\nstatements?\n\nUniversal quantification allows us to make statements\nabout the entire universe of discourse\nExamples:\nl All of my dogs like peanut butter\nl Every even integer is a multiple of two\nl For each positive integer x, 2x > x\n\nGiven a propositional function P(x), we express the\nuniversal quantification of P(x) as \"x P(x)\nWhat is the truth value of \"x P(x)?\nl true if P(x) is true for every x in the universe of discourse\nl false if P(x) is false for even one x in the universe of discourse\n\nExamples\nAll rational numbers are greater than 42\nl Domain: rational numbers\nl Propositional function: Let G(x) o \"x is greater than 42\"\nl Statement: \"x G(x)\nl Truth value: false (counterexample: 1\u20442)\n\nIf a natural number is prime, it has no divisors other than 1\nand itself\nl Domain: natural numbers\nl Propositional functions:\n\u27a3Let P(x) o \"x is prime\"\n\u27a3Let D(x) o \"x has no divisors other than 1 and itself\"\n\nl Statement: \"x [P(x) \u00ae D(x)]\nl Truth value: true (by definition)\n\nExistential quantifiers allow us to make\nstatements about some objects\nExamples:\nl Some elephants are scared of mice\nl There exist integers a, b, and c such that the equality\na2 + b2 = c2 is true\nl There is at least one person who did better than John on the\nmidterm\n\nGiven a propositional function P(x), we express the\nexistential quantification of P(x) as $x P(x)\nWhat is the truth value of $x P(x)?\nl true if P(x) is true for at least one x in the universe of discourse\nl false if P(x) is false for each x in the universe of discourse\n\nExamples\nThe inequality x + 1 < x holds for at least one integer\nl Domain: Integers\nl Propositional function: P(x) o x + 1 < x\nl Statement: $x P(x)\nl Truth value: false\n\nFor some integers, the equality a2 + b2 = c2 is true\nl Domain: Integers\nl Propositional function: P(a, b, c) o a2 + b2 = c2\nl Statement: $a,b,c P(a,b,c)\nl Truth value: true\n\nWe can restrict the domain of quantification\nThe square of every natural number less than 4 is no more\nthan 9\nl Domain: natural numbers\nl Statement: \"x<4 (x2 \u2264 9)\nl Truth value: true\n\nThis is equivalent to writing\n\n\"x [(x < 4) \u00ae (x2 \u2264 9)]\n\nSome integers between 0 and 6 are prime\nl Domain: Integers\nl Propositional function: P(x) o \"x is prime\"\nl Statement: $0\u2264x\u22646 P(x)\nl Truth value: true\nThis is equivalent to writing\n\n$x [(0\u2264x\u22646) \u00d9 P(x)]\n\nPrecedence of quantifiers\nThe universal and existential quantifiers have the\nhighest precedence of all logical operators\nFor example:\nl \"x P(x) \u00d9 Q(x) actually means (\"x P(x)) \u00d9 Q(x)\nl $x P(x) \u00ae Q(x) actually means ($x P(x)) \u00ae Q(x)\n\nFor the most part, we will use parentheses to\ndisambiguate these types of statements\nBut you are still responsible\nfor understanding precedence!\n\nIn-class exercises\nSee on Top Hat\n\nWe can extend the notion of logical equivalence to\nexpressions containing predicates or quantifiers\n\nDefinition: Two statements involving predicates and\nquantifiers are logically equivalent iff they take on the\nsame truth value regardless of which predicates are\nsubstituted into these statements and which domains\nof discourse are used.\n\nProve: $x [P(x) \u00da Q(x)] o $x P(x) \u00da $x Q(x)\nWe must prove each \"direction\" of the equivalence.\nAssume that P and Q have the same domain.\nFirst, prove $x [P(x) \u00da Q(x)] \u00ae $x P(x) \u00da $x Q(x):\nl If $x [P(x) \u00da Q(x)] is true, this means that there is some value v in\nthe domain such that either P(v) is true or Q(v) is true\nl If P(v) is true, then $x P(x) is true and [$x P(x) \u00da $x Q(x)] is true\nl If Q(v) is true, then $x Q(x) is true and [$x P(x) \u00da $x Q(x)] is true\nl Thus $x [P(x) \u00da Q(x)] \u00ae $x P(x) \u00da $x Q(x)\n\nProve: $x [P(x) \u00da Q(x)] o $x P(x) \u00da $x Q(x)\nThen, prove $x P(x) \u00da $x Q(x) \u00ae $x [P(x) \u00da Q(x)]:\nl If $x P(x) \u00da $x Q(x) is true, this means that there is some\nvalue v in the domain such that either P(v) is true or Q(v) is\ntrue\nl If P(v) is true, then $x [P(x) \u00da Q(x)] is true\nl If Q(v) is true, then $x [P(x) \u00da Q(x)] is true\nl Thus $x P(x) \u00da $x Q(x) \u00ae $x [P(x) \u00da Q(x)]\n\nSince $x [P(x) \u00da Q(x)] \u00ae $x P(x) \u00da $x Q(x) and\n$x P(x) \u00da $x Q(x) \u00ae $x [P(x) \u00da Q(x)] then\n$x [P(x) \u00da Q(x)] o $x P(x) \u00da $x Q(x).\n\nWe also have DeMorgan's laws for quantifiers\nNegation over universal quantifier: \u00ac\"x P(x) o $x \u00acP(x)\nIntuition: If P(x) is not true for all x, then\nthere is at least one x for which P(x) is\nfalse\n\nNegation over existential quantifier: \u00ac$x P(x) o \"x \u00acP(x)\nIntuition: If P(x) is not true for at least\none value x, then P(x) is false for all x\n\nThese are very useful logical equivalences, so let's prove\none of them...\n\nProve: \u00ac\"x P(x) o $x \u00acP(x)\nn \u00ac\"x P(x) \u00ae $x \u00acP(x)\nl \u00ac\"x P(x) is true if and only if \"x P(x) is false\nl \"x P(x) is false if and only if there is some v such that \u00acP(v)\nis true\nl If \u00acP(v) is true, then $x \u00acP(x)\n\nn $x \u00acP(x) \u00ae \u00ac\"x P(x)\nl $x \u00acP(x) is true if and only if there is some v such that \u00acP(v)\nis true\nl If \u00acP(v) is true, then clearly P(x) does not hold for all\npossible values in the domain and thus we have \u00ac\"x P(x)\n\nTherefore \u00ac\"x P(x) o $x \u00acP(x).\n\nTranslations from English\nTo translate English sentences into logical expressions:\n1. Rewrite the sentence to make it easier to translate\n2. Determine the appropriate quantifiers to use\n3. Look for words that indicate logical operators\n4. Formalize sentence fragments\n5. Put it all together\n\nExample: At least one person in this classroom is named Bill and\nhas lived in Pittsburgh for 8 years\nExistential quantifier\n\nRewrite: There exists at least one person who is in this\nclassroom, is named Bill, and has lived in Pittsburgh\nfor 8 years\nConjunction\n\nFormalize:\nl C(x) o \"x is in this classroom\"\nl N(x) o \"x is named Bill\"\nl P(x) o \"x has lived in Pittsburgh for 8 years\"\n\nFinal expression: $x [C(x) \u00d9 N(x) \u00d9 P(x)]\n\nExample: If a student is taking CS441, then they have\ntaken high school algebra\nUniversal quantifier\n\nRewrite: For all students, if a student is in CS 441,\nthen they have taken high school algebra\n\nFormalize:\n\nImplication\n\nl C(x) o \"x is taking CS441\"\nl H(x) o \"x has taken high school algebra\"\n\nFinal expression: \"x [C(x) \u00ae H(x)]\n\nNegate the previous example\nDeMorgan's law for\nnegation over the universal\nquantifier\n\n\u00ac\"x [C(x) \u00ae H(x)] o $x \u00ac[C(x) \u00ae H(x)]\no $x \u00ac[\u00acC(x) \u00da H(x)]\no $x [\u00ac\u00acC(x) \u00d9 \u00acH(x)]\na \u00ae b o \u00aca \u00da b\no $x [C(x) \u00d9 \u00acH(x)]\nDeMorgan's law for\nDouble negation law\n\nnegation over\ndisjunction\n\nTranslate back into English:\nl There is a student taking CS441 that has not taken high\nschool algebra!\n\nExample: Jane enjoys drinking some types of tea\nRewrite: There exist some types of tea that Jane\nenjoys drinking\n\nFormalize:\nl T(x) o \"x is a type of tea\"\nl D(x) o \"Jane enjoys drinking x\"\n\nFinal expression: $x [T(x) \u00d9 D(x)]\nNegate the previous example:\n\u00ac$x [T(x) \u00d9 D(x)] o \"x \u00ac[T(x) \u00d9 D(x)]\no \"x [\u00acT(x) \u00da \u00acD(x)]\no \"x [T(x) \u00ae \u00acD(x)]\n\"For all types of drink, if x is a tea, Jane does not enjoy\ndrinking it.\"\n\nIn-class exercises\nProblem 3: Translate the following sentences into\nlogical expressions.\na) Some cows have black spots\nb) At least one student likes to watch football or ice hockey\nc) Any adult citizen of the US can register to vote if he or\nshe is not a convicted felon\n\nProblem 4: Negate the translated expressions from\nproblem 3.
