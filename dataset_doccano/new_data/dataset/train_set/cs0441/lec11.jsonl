How\nmany positive integers not exceeding n are divisible by\nd?\nAnswer: We want to count the number of integers of the\nform dk that are less than n. That is, we want to know\nthe number of integers k with 0 \u2264 dk \u2264 n, or 0 \u2264 k \u2264\nn/d. Therefore, there are \u230an/d\u230b positive integers not\nexceeding n that are divisible by d.\n\nImportant properties of divisibility\nProperty 1: If a | b and a | c, then a | (b + c)\n\nProperty 2: If a | b, then a | bc for all integers c.\n\nProperty 3: If a | b and b | c, then a | c.\n\nDivision algorithm\nTheorem: Let a be an integer and let d be a positive\ninteger. There are unique integers q and r, with\n0 \u2264 r < d, such that a = dq + r.\n\nFor historical reasons, the above theorem is called the\ndivision algorithm, even though it isn't an algorithm!\n\nTerminology: Given a = dq + r\nl a is called the dividend\nl d is called the divisor\nl q is called the quotient\nl r is called the remainder\nl q = a div d\nl r = a mod d\n\ndiv and mod are operators\n\nExamples\nQuestion: What are the quotient and remainder when 123 is\ndivided by 23?\nAnswer: We have that 123 = 23 \u00d7 5 + 8. So the quotient is 123\ndiv 23 = 5, and the remainder is 123 mod 23 = 8.\nQuestion: What are the quotient and remainder when -11 is\ndivided by 3?\nAnswer: Since -11 = 3 \u00d7 -4 + 1, we have that the quotient is -4\nand the remainder is 1.\nRecall that since the remainder must be non-negative, 3 \u00d7 -3 - 2\nis not a valid use of the division theorem!\n\nMany programming languages use the div and\nmod operations\nFor example, in Java, C, and C++\nl / corresponds to div when used on integer arguments\nl % corresponds to mod\n\nPrints out 1\n\npublic static void main(String[] args)\n{\nint x = 2;\nPrints out 2, not 2.5!\nint y = 5;\nfloat z = 2.0;\nSystem.out.println(y/x);\nSystem.out.println(y%x);\nSystem.out.println(y/z);\n\nPrints out 2.5\n\n}\nThis can be a source of many errors, so be careful in\nyour future classes!\n\nIn-class exercises\nProblem 1 & 2: On Top Hat\nProblem 3: Show that if a is an integer and d is an\ninteger greater than 1, then the quotient and remainder\n!\n!\nobtained dividing a by d are \" and a - d \" ,\nrespectively.\n\nSometimes, we care only about the remainder of an\ninteger after it is divided by some other integer\nExample: What time will it be 22 hours from now?\n\nAnswer: If it is 6am now, it will be (6 + 22) mod 24 =\n28 mod 24 = 4 am in 22 hours.\n\nSince remainders can be so important, they have\ntheir own special notation!\nDefinition: If a and b are integers and m is a positive\ninteger, we say that a is congruent to b modulo m if\nm | (a - b). We write this as a \u2261 b (mod m).\nNote: a \u2261 b (mod m) iff a mod m = b mod m.\n\nExamples:\nl Is 17 congruent to 5 modulo 6?\nl Is 24 congruent to 14 modulo 6?\n\nYes, since 6 | (17 - 5)\nNo, since 6 |\n/ (24 - 14)\n\nProperties of congruencies\nTheorem: Let m be a positive integer. The integers a\nand b are congruent modulo m (a \u2261 b (mod m)) iff\nthere is an integer k such that a = b + km.\n\nTheorem: Let m be a positive integer. If a \u2261 b (mod\nm) and c \u2261 d (mod m), then\nl (a + c) \u2261 (b + d) (mod m)\nl ac \u2261 bd (mod m)\n\nCongruencies have many applications within\ncomputer science\nToday we'll look at three:\n1. Hash functions\n2. The generation of pseudorandom numbers\n3. Cryptography\n\nHash functions allow us to quickly and\nefficiently locate data\nProblem: Given a large collection of records, how can we find the\none we want quickly?\nSolution: Apply a hash function that determines the storage\nlocation of the record based on the record's ID. A common hash\nfunction is h(k) = k mod n, where n is the number of available\nstorage locations.\n\nMemory:\n\n0\n\n42 mod 8 = 2\nID: 42\n...\n...\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n276 mod 8 = 4\nID: 276\n...\n...\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n23 mod 8 = 7\nID: 23\n...\n...\n\nMany areas of computer science rely on the ability to\ngenerate pseudorandom numbers\n\nCoding algorithms\nHardware, software, and\nnetwork simulation\nSecurity\n\nNetwork protocols\n\nCongruencies can be used to generate\npseudorandom sequences\nStep 1: Choose\nl A modulus m\nl A multiplier a\nl An increment c\nl A seed x0\n\nStep 2: Apply the following\nl xn+1 = (axn + c) mod m\n\nExample: m = 9, a = 7, c = 4, x0 = 3\nl x1 = 7x0 + 4 mod 9 = 7\u00d73 + 4 mod 9 = 25 mod 9 = 7\nl x2 = 7x1 + 4 mod 9 = 7\u00d77 + 4 mod 9 = 53 mod 9 = 8\nl x3 = 7x2 + 4 mod 9 = 7\u00d78 + 4 mod 9 = 60 mod 9 = 6\nl x4 = 7x3 + 4 mod 9 = 7\u00d76 + 4 mod 9 = 46 mod 9 = 1\nl x5 = 7x4 + 4 mod 9 = 7\u00d71 + 4 mod 9 = 11 mod 9 = 2\nl...\n\nThe field of cryptography makes heavy use of\nnumber theory and congruencies\nCryptography is the study of secret messages\nUses of cryptography:\nl Protecting medical records\nl Storing and transmitting military secrets\nl Secure web browsing\nl...\n\nCongruencies are used in cryptosystems from antiquity, as\nwell as in modern-day algorithms\nSince modern algorithms require quite a bit of background to\ndiscuss, we'll examine an ancient cryptosystem\n\nThe Caesar cipher is based on congruencies\nTo encode a message using the Caesar cipher:\nl Choose a shift index s\nl Convert each letter A-Z into a number 0-25\nl Compute f(p) = p + s mod 26\n\nExample: Let s = 9. Encode \"ATTACK\".\nl ATTACK = 0 19 19 0 2 10\nl f(0) = 9, f(19) = 2, f(2) = 11, f(10) = 19\nl Encrypted message: 9 2 2 9 11 19 = JCCJLT\n\nDecryption involves using the inverse function\nThat is, f-1(p) = p - s mod 26\n\nExample: Assume that s = 3. Decrypt the message\n\"UHWUHDW\".\nl UHWUHDW = 20 7 22 20 7 3 22\nl f-1(20) = 17, f-1(7) = 4, f-1(22) = 19, f-1(3) = 0\nl Decrypted result: 17 4 19 17 4 0 19 = RETREAT\n\nIn-class exercises\nProblem 4 & 5: On Top Hat\n\nFinal thoughts\nn Number theory is the study of integers and their\nproperties\nn Divisibility, modular arithmetic, and congruency are\nused throughout computer science\nn Next time:\nl Prime numbers, GCDs, integer representation (Section 4.2\nand 4.3)\n\n", "label": [[317, 330, "Concept"], [332, 345, "Concept"], [424, 437, "Concept"], [5713, 5726, "Concept"], [6787, 6800, "Concept"], [666, 678, "Concept"], [1078, 1090, "Concept"], [1661, 1673, "Concept"], [6849, 6861, "Concept"], [792, 799, "Concept"], [874, 881, "Concept"], [910, 925, "Concept"], [1005, 1011, "Concept"], [1032, 1040, "Concept"], [231, 249, "Concept"], [1824, 1842, "Concept"], [2035, 2053, "Concept"], [2139, 2147, "Concept"], [2166, 2173, "Concept"], [2192, 2200, "Concept"], [2317, 2325, "Concept"], [2413, 2421, "Concept"], [2501, 2509, "Concept"], [2599, 2607, "Concept"], [3332, 3340, "Concept"], [2219, 2228, "Concept"], [2330, 2339, "Concept"], [2449, 2458, "Concept"], [2514, 2523, "Concept"], [2622, 2631, "Concept"], [2660, 2669, "Concept"], [3345, 3354, "Concept"], [3453, 3462, "Concept"], [2237, 2240, "Concept"], [2258, 2261, "Concept"], [2429, 2432, "Concept"], [2783, 2786, "Concept"], [2858, 2861, "Concept"], [2251, 2254, "Concept"], [2266, 2269, "Concept"], [2466, 2469, "Concept"], [2791, 2794, "Concept"], [2912, 2915, "Concept"], [3615, 3618, "Concept"], [3627, 3630, "Concept"], [3877, 3880, "Concept"], [3898, 3901, "Concept"], [3911, 3914, "Concept"], [3921, 3924, "Concept"], [4175, 4178, "Concept"], [4280, 4283, "Concept"], [4298, 4301, "Concept"], [4332, 4335, "Concept"], [4350, 4353, "Concept"], [4816, 4819, "Concept"], [4893, 4896, "Concept"], [4935, 4938, "Concept"], [4974, 4977, "Concept"], [5358, 5361, "Concept"], [5417, 5420, "Concept"], [5433, 5436, "Concept"], [5444, 5447, "Concept"], [5469, 5472, "Concept"], [5485, 5488, "Concept"], [5496, 5499, "Concept"], [5521, 5524, "Concept"], [5537, 5540, "Concept"], [5548, 5551, "Concept"], [5573, 5576, "Concept"], [5589, 5592, "Concept"], [5600, 5603, "Concept"], [5625, 5628, "Concept"], [5641, 5644, "Concept"], [5652, 5655, "Concept"], [6293, 6296, "Concept"], [6525, 6528, "Concept"], [122, 140, "Concept"], [252, 270, "Concept"], [289, 307, "Concept"], [6863, 6881, "Concept"], [4690, 4703, "Concept"], [4807, 4811, "Concept"], [4484, 4504, "Concept"], [5063, 5083, "Concept"], [5212, 5234, "Concept"], [5254, 5261, "Concept"], [5268, 5278, "Concept"], [5286, 5295, "Concept"], [5302, 5306, "Concept"], [6116, 6129, "Concept"], [6185, 6198, "Concept"], [6211, 6222, "Concept"], [6484, 6500, "Concept"], [6454, 6464, "Concept"], [4508, 4520, "Concept"], [5681, 5693, "Concept"], [5744, 5756, "Concept"], [5797, 5809, "Concept"], [6098, 6110, "Concept"]]}
