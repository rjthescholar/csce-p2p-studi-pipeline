or 123, abc? or error?\nx, ., y\n4, ., y or 4., y ?\nx, ., 5 or x, .5 ?\n4.5 or 4., 5 or 4, ., 5 ?\nor\nor\nor\nor\n\n1.2, ., 3\n1.2, .3\n1., 2.3\n1., 2., 3\n1, ., 2, ., 3\n\n12\n\nuHH\n\u25cf even with such a simple set of tokens, we're already running into\nproblems, and it's not entirely clear where we went wrong.\n\u25cf well, let's first learn a bit about grammars, which can give us some\ntools to talk about these things more rigorously.\n\n13\n\nGrammars\n\n14\n\nLanguages and alphabets\n\u25cf a language is a set of strings. (most useful languages are infinite sets.)\n\u25cf each string is a sequence of symbols chosen from an alphabet.\n\u25cf for example, here's a really dumb language and its alphabet:\n\nL = { \"hi\", \"bye\" }\nA = { 'a', 'b', ..., 'z' }\n\neach symbol in the alphabet\nis called a terminal.\n\nif we generate strings from this alphabet, it's\nkind of obvious whether or not they are in L.\n\n\"hi\" \u2208 L\n\"hii\" \u2209 L\n\"cat\" \u2209 L\n\n...ok, what about a\nmore complicated\nexample?\n15\n\nGrammars\n\u25cf for more complex or infinite languages, you need a grammar: a set\nof rules to decide if a string is in the language.\n\nL = { \"a\", \"aa\", \"aaa\", ... }\nA = { 'a', 'b', ..., 'z' }\n\nwhat is/are the rule(s)\nfor this language?\n\n\"1 or more 'a's\"\n\nokay. but can we write that grammar rule in a more rigorous way?\n\nL: 'a'+\nthis is a nonterminal. it\nisn't part of the alphabet;\nit stands in for some\ncombination of terminals.\n\nthis + says \"repeat the\nprevious thing 1 or\nmore times.\"\n16\n\nA language for specifying languages\n\u25cf we usually specify the lexical and syntactic form of a language with a\nmetalanguage: a concise way of specifying rules.\n\u25cf there are some common patterns for these rules:\n\nL: A B\nR: A | B\nX: A*\nY: A+\nU: A?\nD: (A B)+\n\nA followed by B. (sequencing)\nan A or a B. (alternation)\n\nzero or more As. (repetition)\none or more As. (repetition... again)\nzero or one A, or \"an optional A\".\nparens can group things together.\n\nin these examples, A and B can be terminals (from the\nalphabet) or nonterminals (names of other rules).\n17\n\nLexing a programming language\n\u25cf the alphabet is the character set that the source code is in.\no in our case, that's Unicode!\n\u25cf the language isn't the entire programming language...\no instead, it's the tokens we want to produce.\n\u25cf so, we'll write a rule for each kind of token.\n\nSymbol: '+' | '-' | '{' | '}' | '=' | ('=' '=')\n'quoted' things are terminals, picked from the alphabet.\n\nKeyword: ('i' 'f') | ('e' 'l' 's' 'e') |...\nthat's ugly, but we can make our metalanguage look any way we like.\n\nKeyword: \"if\" | \"else\" | \"fn\" | \"return\"\nthat's better!\n\n18\n\nGetting more complex\n\u25cf rules can refer to other rules. like here:\n\nId:\nIdStart IdCont*\nIdStart: Alphabetic | '_' | '$'\nIdCont: IdStart | Digit\nDigit:\n'0'|'1'|'2'|'3'|'4'|'5'|'6'|'7'|'8'|'9'\nAlphabetic: (a whole bunch of characters)\nso, an identifier starts with a letter or underscore or dollar sign; and\nthat is followed by zero or more of those, plus digits. neat.\nand we could keep going for all the tokens!\n\n19\n\nLiterals!\n\u25cf numeric and string literals can get pretty complicated, but let's keep\nthem simple for now:\n\nIntLit: Digit+\nStrLit: '\"' StrChar* '\"'\nStrChar: <any character except '\"'>\ninteger literals are sequences of digits, and string literals are\nsequences of characters surrounded by double quotes. also it's fine\nto be a bit hand-wavey like in StrChar, as long as the intent is clear.\nbut: what if the input contains the number\n100000000000000000000? isn't it too big...?\ndefining the valid ranges of numbers within the metalanguage\nisn't possible. so we could define that as an additional rule.\n20\n\nUh oh, whitespace.\n\u25cf whitespace isn't a token, but we do have to deal with it somehow.\n\u25cf we can write rules for it, like a real token:\n\nWhitespace: ' ' | '\\t' | '\\n' | Comment\nComment:\n\"//\" CommentChar* CommentEnd\nCommentChar: <any character except '\\n' or Eof>\nCommentEnd: ('\\n' | Eof)non-consuming\nwoah what the heck is that\n\nthis is a lookahead: it checks if the next character is a newline\nor EOF, but it does not make it part of the Comment.\nit feels a little kludgey, but sometimes\nlookaheads are just what you need.\n\njust... don't use them too much.\n\n21\n\nWrapping it up and putting a bow on top\n\u25cf once we have a rule for each kind of token, we can do this:\n\nToken:\nSymbol | Keyword | Id | IntLit | StrLit\nProgram: (Whitespace? Token)* Whitespace? Eof\nhere, Program is a special rule: it's our top-level or start rule.\nif we want to translate this grammar into code that\nlexes, it's where we start - it's the outermost loop.\n\nbut wait. if we spent all this time writing the\nlexical rules in a formalized, rigorous way...\ncouldn't we just have a program compile\nthe grammar itself into a lexer?\n22\n\nCOMPILER COMPILERS \ud83e\udd2f\n\u25cf yes, this is A Thing.\n\u25cf there are many tools which will take some kind of metalanguage as\nthe input, and produce a lexer program as an output.\no (or a parser, but we haven't gotten to those yet)\n\n\u25cf however...\no most are tightly tied to the language whose code they output.\no they're really complex, to be as flexible as possible.\no ...but, it can be awkward to fit your grammars into their rules.\no they can give really confusing/terrible error messages on invalid\nlexer input.\n\u25cf and honestly, writing your own lexer is not that complicated.\no and, yanno, it's a compilers course, so you have to do it. (:\n\n23\n\nDealing with Ambiguity\n\n24\n\nDealing with ambiguity\n\u25cf ambiguity is when you have > 1 possible \"correct\" tokenizations.\n\u25cf consider these snippets of Java.\n\nif(x == 3) is this [==] or [=, =]?\n3.4\n\nis this [3.4] or [3., 4]?\n\nabc123\n123abc\n\nis this [abc123] or [abc, 123] or [ab, c123] or...?\nwhy do we think this is an error when the above is not?\n\non this line, >> is a right shift...\nint y = x >> 3;\nList<List<String>> l; but here, it's two right angle brackets?\nthere are three ways I can think of to resolve ambiguity.\n25\n\nApproach 1: Maximal Munch\n\u25cf maximal munch is a strategy that says: always try to make the\nbiggest token possible, going left-to-right.\n\nif(x == 3) this is [==].\n3.4\n\nthis is [3.4].\n\nabc123\n123abc\n\nthis is [abc123].\nthis is an error because we start lexing a number, and\nthen hit a non-numerical character.\nalthough, it doesn't have to be; we could say \"3x\" is another way of writing \"3 * x\", couldn't we?\n\nint y = x >> 3;\nList<List<String>> l; but this still presents an issue...\n26\n\nApproach 2: Deal with it later!\n\u25cf we can have the parser (the next step) disambiguate things that\nwould be impossible to detect in the lexer.\nlexers are usually specified as regular languages,\nwhich cannot detect arbitrarily nested brackets.\n\nList<List<String>> l;\nthe lexer cannot know that >> is a pair of closing brackets\nwithout knowing that there are two unpaired open brackets.\n\nso, we have the parser say \"oh, I currently have two open brackets;\nthis >> must be a pair of closing brackets and not a right-shift.\"\nbut why bother making things harder for ourselves?\n27\n\nApproach 3: \"Doctor, it hurts when I do this\"\n\u25cf we could just define our rules so they're unambiguous.\nList!(List!(String)) l;\n\nin the D language, templates\n(generics) use parens instead.\n\nthe parser then knows !( is a \"template open paren\".\nl :: List List String\nm :: List (List String)\n\nin Haskell, generics don't require\nany symbols, but can use parens.\n\nx shr 3\n\nor, we could redefine right shift to\nuse some spelling other than >>.\n\n28\n\nReally bad cases of ambiguity\n\u25cf if you aren't careful, you can end up with nasty situations.\n\nLexer\n\nParser\n\nSemantic\nAnalyzer\n\nC and C++ have this situation, where you cannot correctly lex\nthe source code until you've done (some) semantic analysis.\n\nthis sucks! it makes the compiler slower,\nharder to write, and harder to reason about.\nfortunately, we have the hindsight of decades\nof language design and can avoid this stuff :)\n29\n\nThe examples\n\u25cf first, there's an example showing how Rust's match statement works,\ncalled rust_match.\n\u25cf there's a small example, lexing_toy, that shows how simple it can be\nto make a lexer.\no it only has a few kinds of tokens, and is written in a different style\nfrom the project, cause I don't wanna give too much away (:\no but it shows the general \"shape\" of a lexing algorithm.\n\n30\n\n", "label": [[0, 6, "Concept"], [327, 333, "Concept"], [418, 424, "Concept"], [2334, 2340, "Concept"], [6184, 6190, "Concept"], [10270, 10276, "Concept"], [12320, 12326, "Concept"], [430, 438, "Concept"], [580, 585, "Concept"], [615, 620, "Concept"], [669, 674, "Concept"], [1179, 1184, "Concept"], [1889, 1894, "Concept"], [8853, 8858, "Concept"], [9002, 9007, "Concept"], [9352, 9357, "Concept"], [9398, 9403, "Concept"], [10640, 10645, "Concept"], [10774, 10779, "Concept"], [11616, 11621, "Concept"], [12140, 12145, "Concept"], [9038, 9044, "Concept"], [10555, 10561, "Concept"], [10906, 10912, "Concept"], [11273, 11279, "Concept"], [11623, 11629, "Concept"], [711, 716, "Concept"], [6454, 6459, "Concept"], [7800, 7805, "Concept"], [7888, 7893, "Concept"], [8401, 8406, "Concept"], [8425, 8430, "Concept"], [8494, 8499, "Concept"], [10119, 10124, "Concept"], [1117, 1127, "Concept"], [1284, 1294, "Concept"], [1297, 1307, "Concept"], [7767, 7777, "Concept"], [7781, 7791, "Concept"], [7896, 7906, "Concept"], [8482, 8492, "Concept"], [8502, 8512, "Concept"], [7928, 7935, "Concept"], [7936, 7943, "Concept"], [8198, 8205, "Concept"], [1087, 1098, "Concept"], [1545, 1556, "Concept"], [1708, 1719, "Concept"], [2215, 2222, "Concept"], [8146, 8153, "Concept"], [1909, 1922, "Concept"], [2087, 2098, "Concept"], [2144, 2157, "Concept"], [750, 758, "Concept"], [861, 869, "Concept"], [2564, 2572, "Concept"], [2632, 2640, "Concept"], [3126, 3134, "Concept"], [4664, 4672, "Concept"], [4837, 4845, "Concept"], [5257, 5265, "Concept"], [5359, 5367, "Concept"], [5628, 5636, "Concept"], [5719, 5727, "Concept"], [6205, 6213, "Concept"], [6315, 6323, "Concept"], [6353, 6361, "Concept"], [9127, 9135, "Concept"], [11217, 11225, "Concept"], [11909, 11917, "Concept"], [4791, 4799, "Concept"], [4854, 4862, "Concept"], [4932, 4940, "Concept"], [4997, 5005, "Concept"], [5506, 5514, "Concept"], [6130, 6138, "Concept"], [6220, 6228, "Concept"], [6557, 6565, "Concept"], [5201, 5208, "Concept"], [5416, 5423, "Concept"], [8614, 8621, "Concept"], [8831, 8838, "Concept"], [4953, 4961, "Concept"], [5472, 5483, "Concept"], [5735, 5747, "Concept"], [6645, 6657, "Concept"], [7680, 7692, "Concept"], [8961, 8973, "Concept"], [5898, 5908, "Concept"], [5924, 5935, "Concept"], [5956, 5966, "Concept"], [5985, 5995, "Concept"], [6028, 6036, "Concept"], [6981, 6991, "Concept"], [645, 647, "Concept"], [6809, 6811, "Concept"], [8451, 8453, "Concept"], [6568, 6575, "Concept"], [6681, 6688, "Concept"], [8441, 8448, "Concept"], [3789, 3795, "Concept"], [4918, 4924, "Concept"], [6462, 6468, "Concept"], [8432, 8438, "Concept"], [622, 628, "Concept"], [7263, 7269, "Concept"], [8456, 8462, "Concept"], [7278, 7284, "Concept"], [8465, 8471, "Concept"], [8098, 8107, "Concept"], [10033, 10046, "Concept"], [10049, 10062, "Concept"], [9511, 9520, "Concept"], [9539, 9548, "Concept"], [9551, 9560, "Concept"], [10006, 10015, "Concept"], [11542, 11551, "Concept"], [8573, 8583, "Concept"], [378, 389, "Concept"], [601, 612, "Concept"], [906, 917, "Concept"], [6259, 6270, "Concept"], [11716, 11727, "Concept"], [6300, 6307, "Concept"], [11753, 11770, "Concept"], [8017, 8020, "Concept"], [8042, 8045, "Concept"], [8157, 8160, "Concept"], [8514, 8517, "Concept"], [2690, 2695, "Concept"]]}
