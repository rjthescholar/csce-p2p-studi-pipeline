J/K.\n\u2022 C was invented in 1972 alongside UNIX to an effort to aid\napplication development of that system.\n\u2022 Eventually UNIX itself was rewritten in C cementing C as a systems\nlanguage.\n\u2022 As such, C provides a high-level abstraction of assembly / machinecode and a low-level abstraction of memory, from the perspective\nof the C programmer.\n\u25aa This is important for programming systems code!\n\u25aa Allows full manipulation of memory (to one's peril, often.)\n\u25aa This, in turn, allows for full manipulation of cpu/hardware.\n23\n\nWhy the C Programming Language??\n\u2022 Learning C helps you understand Systems.\n\u2022 Understanding Systems lets you\nmake them better.\n\u25aa Or break them. \u263a\n\n\u2022 C reveals the underlying memory\nmodel and execution environment.\n\u25aa Lets you understand any program.\n\u25aa Even if you do not have the original code.\n\n\u2022 Failing at C helps you learn...\n\u25aa Because then you debug your program.\n\u25aa And debuggers are very useful tools.\n24\n\nHow people use these skills\n\u2022 Writing Operating Systems\n\u25aa not the entire thing hopefully\n\u25aa ... but parts are generally gonna be C/C-like\n\u25aa Understanding systems means knowing how to\nmitigate/improve performance.\n\u2022 Important that your abstractions don't hurt performance\nbecause EVERY user application suffers.\n\u2022 Yet, performance is not the only consideration;\nunderstanding abstractions should help alleviate design\nfatigue. https://wilkie.how/posts/kaashoeks-law\n\n\u25aa Linux and Device Drivers: 10+ million lines of C\n\u2022 Yikes.\n\u2022 But, learning C means you can potentially read this and\nlearn more about / improve / extend Linux.\n\n25\n\nHow people use these skills\n\u2022 Debugging Higher-level Programs\n\u25aa Yes, even Python itself crashes!\n\u25aa ... and the Python interpreter is written in C ...\n\u25aa ... and computers don't understand C ...\n\u25aa ... so it's gonna give you an assembly dump.\n\n26\n\nHow people use these skills\n\u2022 Creating Art\n\u25aa Real-time art includes not just video games.\n\u25aa There is a lot of fun and skill involved.\n\u25aa Being creative within a constraint has been\nvery alluring.\n\u25aa The Demoscene is such a community.\n\n27\n\nHow people use these skills\n\u2022 Breaking Things for Great Good\n\n\u25aa Or great bad... I'm not your parents.\n\u25aa Why? Old programs with copy-protection\nare still useful.\n\u2022 Original source code backed up??\nWhat time do you think this is?? Never????\n\n\u25aa And it is technically legal to reverse-engineer\nand/or change them.\n\u2022 The best kind of legal.\n\u2022 But I'm not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. lol\n\n\u25aa You will typically use a \"debugger\" to break\ndown a program's behavior.\n\u25aa And then patch it to do / not-do things.\n\u25aa Generally done professionally by librarians/archivists.\n\u25aa We will also do this!!\n\n28\n\nHow YOU will use these skills\n\u2022 All of the above!!\n\u2022 And, of course, TO HAVE FUN!!\n\n29\n\n", "label": [[45, 52, "Concept"], [1345, 1352, "Concept"], [1801, 1808, "Concept"], [6731, 6738, "Concept"], [6872, 6879, "Concept"], [7225, 7232, "Concept"], [7270, 7277, "Concept"], [7306, 7313, "Concept"], [7357, 7364, "Concept"], [7475, 7482, "Concept"], [7486, 7493, "Concept"], [7665, 7672, "Concept"], [7680, 7687, "Concept"], [8048, 8055, "Concept"], [8261, 8268, "Concept"], [8374, 8381, "Concept"], [8426, 8433, "Concept"], [8587, 8594, "Concept"], [8622, 8629, "Concept"], [9179, 9186, "Concept"], [9387, 9394, "Concept"], [9597, 9604, "Concept"], [9622, 9629, "Concept"], [9989, 9996, "Concept"], [10094, 10101, "Concept"], [6731, 6750, "Concept"], [1134, 1147, "Concept"], [7004, 7017, "Concept"], [8944, 8957, "Concept"], [9538, 9551, "Concept"], [6729, 6759, "Concept"], [6767, 6779, "Concept"], [7059, 7071, "Concept"], [7073, 7076, "Concept"], [7101, 7104, "Concept"], [7080, 7099, "Concept"], [7108, 7129, "Concept"], [7132, 7151, "Concept"], [7225, 7239, "Concept"], [7270, 7290, "Concept"], [6862, 6879, "Concept"], [7655, 7672, "Concept"], [9979, 9996, "Concept"], [8156, 8158, "Concept"], [8749, 8751, "Concept"], [7675, 7687, "Concept"], [8369, 8381, "Concept"], [8421, 8433, "Concept"], [7690, 7706, "Concept"], [7709, 7724, "Concept"], [8156, 8165, "Concept"], [8167, 8180, "Concept"], [8182, 8196, "Concept"], [8523, 8534, "Concept"], [8844, 8854, "Concept"], [8824, 8837, "Concept"], [6800, 6822, "Concept"], [6800, 6809, "Concept"], [6814, 6822, "Concept"], [6825, 6842, "Concept"], [6846, 6859, "Concept"], [6883, 6892, "Concept"], [6895, 6902, "Concept"], [6905, 6931, "Concept"], [6948, 6962, "Concept"], [6971, 6990, "Concept"], [9721, 9742, "Concept"], [11476, 11484, "Concept"], [10418, 10432, "Concept"], [1304, 1313, "Concept"], [8136, 8140, "Concept"], [8141, 8145, "Concept"], [8146, 8153, "Concept"], [8566, 8571, "Concept"]]}
