(NVRAM)\n\u25aa They are really neat! (and slow!)\n\u25aa But wow they really complicate things!!\n\u2022 Consider the implications.\n\n\u2022 Let's dig in...\nSpring 2019/2020\n\n8\n\nDisks\nYou throw them and dogs chase them.

(Yes, like FM radio)\n\u25aa Disks actually store data using a form of this encoding!\nSpring 2019/2020\n\n11\n\nData and magnets... how do they work\n\u2022 We can use magnets to represent\n\nand\n\n(discrete binary)\n\n\u25aa The drive's read head contains a sensor that detects the \"magnetic flux\"\n\u25aa It can sense a change in magnetism over time.\n\u2022 This shows the ideal world, without any modulation:\n\nN\n\nS\n\nS\n\nN\n\nN\n\nN\n\nS\n\nS\n\nS\n\nS\n\nN\n\nN\n\nS\n\nS\n\nS\n\nN\n\nN\n\nN\n\nSpring 2019/2020\n\nNorth and South poles indicate stored values\n\n12\n\nThe peril of nature...\n\u2022 The magnetic drives read the change in magnetism.\n\u25aa It is difficult to tell the difference between two consecutive magnets...\n\u25aa This is also because co-aligned magnets HATE being next to each other.\n\u2022 Opposites attract, n'at.

Latency: the time for the platter to spin.\n\u25aa Data is located at a two-dimensional coordinate\non a spinning surface.\n\u2022 so the math is not trivial.\n\n\u2022 Seek time is relative to the current\nposition of the head.\n\u25aa The closer the next bit of data you need...\n\u2022 The sooner it will get there.\n\n\u2022 So... to reduce the seek time to nil...\n\u25aa We position adjacent data in the same\ncylinder and respective sector.\n\u25aa Next set goes into subsequent sector. Heads don't move; the platters spin.\nSpring 2019/2020\n\n18\n\nAin't no platter like a hard disk platter 'cause a hard disk platter don't stop\n\n\u2022 Seek time is the time it takes for the head to get into\nposition.

Seek time is zero, but maximum latency loss.\nSpring 2019/2020\n\n19\n\nAin't no platter like a hard disk platter 'cause a hard disk platter don't stop\n\n\u2022 Seek time is the time it takes for the head to get into\nposition.

Recall terminal redirection.)\n- a file for error output.\n- the input file (could be a file on disk... or user input in the terminal.)\n\n\u2022 The OS maintains a table of open files per process. When it sees a\nsyscall such as\nor\n, it uses that table to determine the file.\nSpring 2019/2020\n\n25\n\nProcesses and Files\n\u2022 The OS maintains a table of open files per process.
