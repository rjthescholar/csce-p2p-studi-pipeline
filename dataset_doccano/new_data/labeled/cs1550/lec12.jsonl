Thank you.\n\n\u2022\n\nWhy Hoare semantics are necessary for a user level\nimplementation. The implementation of the user level condition\nvariable was also generally confusing without fully understanding\nwhy it's being done that way. I'll need to review this on my own\nCS 1550 - Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n4\n\nMuddiest Points (Deadlocks)\n\u2022 How often do deadlocks occur even if the algorithm tells\nus it is possible to not deadlock\n\nCS 1550 - Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n5\n\nMuddiest Points (Misc.)\n\u2022 n/a BUT PLEASE EXTEND PROJ 1.

CPU Scheduling\n\nHow does the short-term scheduler select the next\nprocess to run?\n\nCS 1550 - Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n8\n\nCPU Scheduling\n\u2022 Scheduling the processor among all ready\nprocesses\n\u2022 User-oriented criteria\n\u2022 Response Time: Elapsed time between the submission\nof a request and the receipt of a response\n\n\u2022 Turnaround Time: Elapsed time between

1550 - Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n9\n\nShort-Term Scheduler Dispatcher\n\u2022 The dispatcher is the module that gives control of the\nCPU to the process selected by the short-term\nscheduler\n\u2022 The functions of the dispatcher include:\n\u2022 Switching context\n\u2022 Switching to user mode\n\u2022 Jumping to the location in the user program to restart\nexecution\n\n\u2022 The dispatch latency must be minimal\n\nCS 1550 - Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n10\n\nThe CPU-I/O Cycle\n\u2022 Processes require alternate use of processor and I/O\nin a repetitive fashion\n\u2022 Each cycle consist of a CPU burst followed by an I/O\nburst\n\u2022 A process terminates on a CPU burst\n\n\u2022 CPU-bound processes have longer CPU bursts than\nI/O-bound processes\n\nCS 1550 - Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n11\n\nResponse time vs. Turnaround time\n\nCS 1550 - Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n12\n\nScheduling

may be interrupted and moved to the\nReady state by the OS\n\u2022 Prevents one process from monopolizing the processor\n\nCS 1550 - Operating Systems - Sherif Khattab\n\n14\n\nProcess Mix
