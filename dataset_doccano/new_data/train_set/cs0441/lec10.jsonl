We use the notation an\nto denote the image of the integer n. an is called a\nterm of the sequence.\n\nExamples:\nl 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11\nl 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, ...\n\nA sequence with 6 terms\nAn infinite sequence\n\nNote: The second example can be described as the\nsequence {an} where an = 1/n\n\nWhat makes sequences so special?\nQuestion: Aren't sequences just sets?\nAnswer: The elements of a sequence are members of a\nset, but a sequence is ordered, a set is not.\n\nQuestion: How are sequences different from ordered\nn-tuples?\nAnswer: An ordered n-tuple is ordered, but always\ncontains n elements. Sequences can be infinite!\n\nSome special sequences\nGeometric progressions are sequences of the form\n{arn} where a and r are real numbers\n\nExamples:\nl 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, ...\nl 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, ...\n\na = 1, r = 1\u20442\na = 1, r = -1\n\nArithmetic progressions are sequences of the form\n{a + nd} where a and d are real numbers.\n\nExamples:\nl 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...\nl -10, -15, -20, -25, ...\n\na = 2, d = 2\na = -10, d = -5\n\nSometimes we need to figure out the formula for a\nsequence given only a few terms\nQuestions to ask yourself:\n1. Are there runs of the same value?\n2. Are terms obtained by multiplying the previous value by a\nparticular amount? (Possible geometric sequence)\n3. Are terms obtained by adding a particular amount to the\nprevious value? (Possible arithmetic sequence)\n4. Are terms obtained by combining previous terms in a\ncertain way?\n5. Are there cycles amongst terms?\n\nWhat are the formulas for these sequences?\nProblem 1: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, ...\nl Arithmetic sequence with a = 1, d = 4\n\nProblem 2: 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, ...\nl Geometric sequence with a = 1, r = 3\n\nProblem 3: 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, ...\nl Sequence in which the nth prime number is listed n times\n\nProblem 4: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...\nl Each term is the sum of the two previous terms\nThis is called the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nSometimes we want to find the sum of the terms\nin a sequence\nSummation notation lets us compactly\nrepresent the sum of terms am + am+1 + ... + an\nUpper limit\n\nIndex of summation\n\nLower limit\n\nExample: \u22111\u2264i\u22645 i2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 55\n\nThe usual laws of arithmetic still apply\n$\n\n$\n\n$\n\n$\n\n! ax! + by! - cz! = a ! x! + b ! y! - c ! z!\n!\"#\n\n!\"#\n\n!\"#\n\n!\"#\n\nConstant factors can be pulled out of the\nsummation\nA summation over a sum (or difference) can be split into a\nsum (or difference) of smaller summations\n\nExample:\nl \u22111\u2264j\u22643 (4j + j2) = (4+1) + (8+4) + (12+9) = 38\nl 4\u22111\u2264j\u22643 j + \u22111\u2264j\u22643 j2 = 4(1+2+3) + (1+4+9) = 38\n\nExample sums\nExample: Express the sum of the first 50 terms of the\nsequence 1/n2 for n = 1, 2, 3, ...\nAnswer:\n\nExample: What is the value of\nAnswer:\n\nWe can also compute the summation of the\nelements of some set\nExample: Compute\nAnswer: (0 + 2) + (2 + 2) + (4 + 2) + (6 + 2) = 20\n\nExample: Let f(x) = x3 + 1. Compute\nAnswer: f(1) + f(3) + f(5) + f(7) = 2 + 28 + 126 + 344 = 500\n\nSometimes it is helpful to shift the index of a\nsummation\nThis is particularly useful when combining two or more\nsummations. For example:\nLet j = k - 1\n\nNeed to add 1\nto each j\n\nSummations can be nested within one another\nOften, you'll see this when analyzing nested loops\nwithin a program (i.e., CS 1501/1502)\nExpand inner sum\n\nExample: Compute\nSolution:\nSimplify if possible\n\nExpand outer sum\n\nIn-class exercises\nOn Top Hat\n\nComputing the sum of a geometric series by\nhand is time consuming...\nWould you really want to calculate\n\nby hand?\n\nFortunately, we have a closed-form solution for\ncomputing the sum of a geometric series:\n\nSo,\n\nWhy?\n\nProof of geometric series closed form\n\nThere are other closed form summations that\nyou should know\nSum\n\nClosed Form\n\nWe can use the notion of sequences to analyze\nthe cardinality of infinite sets\nDefinition: Two sets A and B have the same cardinality\nif and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence (a\nbijection) from A to B.\n\nDefinition: A finite set or a set that has the same\ncardinality as the natural numbers (or the positive\nintegers) is called countable. A set that is not\ncountable is called uncountable.\nImplication: Any sequence {an} ranging over the natural\nnumbers is countable.\n\nShow that the set of even positive integers is countable\n\nProof #1 (Graphical): We have the following 1-to-1\ncorrespondence between the positive integers and the\neven positive integers:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 ...\nSo, the even positive integers are countable. \u274f\n\nProof #2: We can define the even positive integers as\nthe sequence {2k} for all k \u2208 Z+, so it has the same\ncardinality as Z+, and is thus countable. \u274f\n\nIs the set of all rational numbers countable?\nPerhaps surprisingly, yes!\n\nThis yields the sequence 1/1, 1/2, 2/1, 3/1, 1/3, ..., so the\nset of rational numbers is countable. \u274f\n\nIs the set of real numbers countable?\nNo, it is not. We can prove this using a proof method called\ndiagonalization, invented by Georg Cantor.\n\nProof: Assume that the set of real numbers is countable. Then\nthe subset of real numbers between 0 and 1 is also countable, by\ndefinition. This implies that the real numbers can be listed in\nsome order, say, r1, r2, r3 ....\nLet the decimal representation these numbers be:\nr1 = 0.d11d12d13d14...\nr2 = 0.d21d22d23d24...\nr3 = 0.d31d32d33d34...\n...\nWhere dij \u2208 {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} \u2200i,j\n\nProof (continued)\nNow, form a new decimal number r=0.d1d2d3... where di = 0 if dii =\n1, and di=1 otherwise.\nExample:\nr1 = 0.123456...\nr2 = 0.234524...\nr3 = 0.631234...\n...\nr = 0.010...\nNote that the ith decimal place of r differs from the ith decimal\nplace of each ri, by construction. Thus r is not included in the list\nof all real numbers between 0 and 1. This is a contradiction of\nthe assumption that all real numbers between 0 and 1 could be\nlisted. Thus, not all real numbers can be listed, and R is\nuncountable. \u274f\n\nFinal thoughts\nn Sequences allow us to represent (potentially\ninfinite) ordered lists of elements\nn Summation notation is a compact representation for\nadding together the elements of a sequence\nn We can use sequences to help us compare the\ncardinality of infinite sets\nn Next time:\nl Integers and division (Section 4.1)\n\n", "label": [[396, 404, "Concept"], [556, 564, "Concept"], [629, 637, "Concept"], [663, 671, "Concept"], [722, 730, "Concept"], [849, 857, "Concept"], [886, 894, "Concept"], [1521, 1529, "Concept"], [1717, 1725, "Concept"], [1823, 1831, "Concept"], [2025, 2033, "Concept"], [2097, 2105, "Concept"], [2192, 2200, "Concept"], [2373, 2381, "Concept"], [2436, 2444, "Concept"], [3071, 3079, "Concept"], [4560, 4568, "Concept"], [4970, 4978, "Concept"], [5154, 5162, "Concept"], [6477, 6485, "Concept"], [544, 548, "Concept"], [2302, 2306, "Concept"], [654, 671, "Concept"], [994, 1009, "Concept"], [1707, 1725, "Concept"], [2087, 2105, "Concept"], [1812, 1831, "Concept"], [2014, 2033, "Concept"], [2363, 2381, "Concept"], [262, 280, "Concept"], [2445, 2463, "Concept"], [6392, 6410, "Concept"], [2530, 2541, "Concept"], [2563, 2574, "Concept"], [2543, 2561, "Concept"], [3833, 3849, "Concept"], [3996, 4012, "Concept"], [4035, 4051, "Concept"], [3948, 3968, "Concept"], [312, 323, "Concept"], [4193, 4204, "Concept"], [4265, 4276, "Concept"], [4409, 4420, "Concept"], [5019, 5030, "Concept"], [6532, 6543, "Concept"], [312, 340, "Concept"], [4193, 4221, "Concept"], [6532, 6560, "Concept"], [4303, 4328, "Concept"], [4332, 4341, "Concept"], [4481, 4490, "Concept"], [4510, 4519, "Concept"], [4610, 4619, "Concept"], [4669, 4678, "Concept"], [4898, 4907, "Concept"], [5050, 5059, "Concept"], [5099, 5108, "Concept"], [5227, 5236, "Concept"], [5268, 5277, "Concept"], [5430, 5439, "Concept"], [5497, 5506, "Concept"], [4530, 4541, "Concept"], [6276, 6287, "Concept"], [4371, 4381, "Concept"], [4428, 4443, "Concept"], [4648, 4665, "Concept"], [4758, 4775, "Concept"], [4789, 4806, "Concept"], [4876, 4893, "Concept"], [4945, 4962, "Concept"], [4643, 4665, "Concept"], [4784, 4806, "Concept"], [4871, 4893, "Concept"], [4940, 4962, "Concept"], [5082, 5098, "Concept"], [5207, 5223, "Concept"], [1178, 1190, "Concept"], [1367, 1379, "Concept"], [5255, 5267, "Concept"], [5414, 5426, "Concept"], [5460, 5472, "Concept"], [5545, 5557, "Concept"], [6098, 6110, "Concept"], [6179, 6191, "Concept"], [6239, 6251, "Concept"], [4996, 4998, "Concept"], [5034, 5036, "Concept"]]}
