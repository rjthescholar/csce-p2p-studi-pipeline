If P(1) is true, then\nP(2) is true...\n\nProcedure:\n1. Prove P(0)\n2. Show that P(k) \u2192 P(k+1) for any arbitrary k\n3. Conclude that P(x) is true \u2200x\u2208N\n\nP(0)\nP(k) \u2192 P(k+1)\n\u2234\u2200x\u2208N P(x)\n\nStrong mathematical induction is another flavor\nof induction\nGoal: Prove \u2200x\u2208N P(x).\nProcedure:\n1. Prove P(0)\n2. Show that [P(0) \u2227 P(1) \u2227 ... \u2227 P(k) ] \u2192 P(k+1) for any\narbitrary k\n3. Conclude that P(x) is true \u2200x\u2208N\n\nP(0)\n[P(0) \u2227 P(1) \u2227 ... \u2227 P(k) ] \u2192 P(k+1)\n\u2234\u2200x\u2208N P(x)\n\nSo what's the big deal?\nRecall: In mathematical induction, our inductive\nhypothesis allows us to assume that P(k) is true and use\nthis knowledge to prove P(k+1)\nHowever, in strong induction, we can assume that P(0) \u2227\nP(1) \u2227 ... \u2227 P(k) is true before trying to prove P(k+1)\nFor certain types of proofs, this is much easier than\ntrying to prove P(k+1) from P(k) alone.\n\nFor example...\n\nShow that if n is an integer greater than 1, then n can\nbe written as the product of primes\nP(n) \u2261 n can be written as a product of primes\nBase case: P(2): 2 = 21\n\n\u2714\n\nI.H.: Assume that P(2) \u2227 ... \u2227 P(k) holds for an arbitrary k\nInductive step: We will now show that [P(2) \u2227 ... \u2227 P(k)] \u2192 P(k+1)\nn Two cases to consider: k+1 prime and k+1 composite\nn If k+1 is prime, then we're done\nn If k+1 is composite, then by definition, k+1 = ab\nn Since 2 \u2264 a \u2264 k and 2 \u2264 b \u2264 k, a and b can be written as\nproducts of primes by the I.H.\nn Thus, k+1 can be written as a product of primes\nConclusion: Since we have proved the base case and the inductive\ncase, the claim holds by strong induction \u274f\n\nIs strong induction somehow more powerful than\nmathematical induction?\nThe ability to assume P(0) \u2227 P(1) \u2227 ... \u2227 P(k) true before\nproving P(k+1) seems more powerful than just assuming\nP(k) is true\nPerhaps surprisingly, mathematical induction, strong\ninduction, and well ordering are all equivalent!\nThat is, a proof using one of these methods can always\nbe written using the other two methods\n\nThis may not be easy, though!\n\nProve that every amount of postage of 12 cents or more can be\nformed using just 4-cent and 5-cent stamps\nP(n) \u2261 n cents of postage can be made using 4- and 5-cent stamps\nBase case: P(12): 3 4-cent stamps\nP(13): 1 5-cent stamp, 2 4-cent stamps\nP(14): 2 5-cent stamps, 1 4-cent stamp\nP(15): 3 5-cent stamps\n\n\u2714\n\nI.H.: Assume that P(12) \u2227 ... \u2227 P(k) holds for an arbitrary integer k\nInductive step: We will now show that [P(12) \u2227 ... \u2227 P(k)] \u2192 P(k+1)\nn By the I.H., we can make k-3 cents worth of postage using\nonly 4-cent and 5-cent stamps\nn By adding another 4-cent stamp, we end up with k+1 cents\nworth of postage\nConclusion: Since we have proved the base case and the inductive\ncase, the claim holds by strong induction \u274f\n\nProve that every amount of postage of 12 cents or more can be\nformed using just 4-cent and 5-cent stamps\nP(n) \u2261 n cents of postage can be made using 4- and 5-cent stamps\nBase case: P(12): 3 4-cent stamps \u2714\nI.H.: Assume that P(k) holds for an arbitrary integer k\nInductive step: We will now show that P(k) \u2192 P(k+1)\nn We can k cents using 4- and 5-cent stamps, by the I.H.\nn If at least one 4-cent stamp was used, remove that stamp and\nadd in a 5-cent stamp, thereby making k+1 cents of postage\nn If no 4-cent stamps were used, then only 5-cent stamps were\nused.\nn Since k > 12, at least 3 5-cent stamps were used.\nn Replace 3 5-cent stamps with 4 4-cent stamps, thereby making\nk+1 cents of postage\nConclusion: Since we have proved the base case and the inductive\ncase, the claim holds by mathematical induction \u274f\n\nSo when should we use strong induction?\nIf it is straightforward to prove P(k+1) from P(k) alone,\nuse mathematical induction\nP(0)\n\nP(1)\n\n...\n\nP(k-1)\n\nP(k)\n\nP(k+1)\n\nIf it would be easier to prove P(k+1) using one or more\nP(j) for 0 \u2264 j < k, use strong induction\nP(0)\n\nP(1)\n\n...\n\nP(k-1)\n\nP(k)\n\n?\n\nP(k+1)\n\nIn-class exercises\nProblem 1: Use strong induction to prove that any\nwhole dollar amount greater than or equal to $4 can\nbe formed using only $2 and $5 bills.\n\nIn-class exercises\nProblem 2: Suppose you have a box of Maltesers\ncontaining n candies, and you want to split it into n piles\nof 1 candy each by repeatedly splitting a pile into two\nsmaller piles. Each time you split a pile, you multiply the\nnumber of candies in each of the two smaller piles you\nform, and add it to a running total. For example, if you\nsplit a pile of 13 candies into two piles of size 4 and 9,\nyou would add 4\u00d79 = 36 to the total.\nShow that, no matter how you split the piles, the sum of\n! !\"#\nthe products computed at each step will equal\n$\n\nFinal Thoughts\nn Strong induction lets us prove universally quantified\nstatements using this inference rule:\nP(0)\n[P(0) \u2227 P(1) \u2227 ... \u2227 P(k) ] \u2192 P(k+1)\n\u2234\u2200x\u2208N P(x)\n\nn Although sometimes more convenient than mathematical\ninduction, strong induction is no more powerful\n\n", "label": [[185, 207, "Concept"], [511, 533, "Concept"], [808, 830, "Concept"], [1889, 1911, "Concept"], [2061, 2083, "Concept"], [3777, 3799, "Concept"], [3905, 3927, "Concept"], [504, 533, "Concept"], [109, 125, "Concept"], [946, 962, "Concept"], [1822, 1838, "Concept"], [1845, 1861, "Concept"], [2970, 2986, "Concept"], [3825, 3841, "Concept"], [4047, 4063, "Concept"], [4140, 4156, "Concept"], [4845, 4861, "Concept"], [5057, 5073, "Concept"], [221, 254, "Concept"], [1296, 1305, "Concept"], [1769, 1778, "Concept"], [2437, 2446, "Concept"], [2917, 2926, "Concept"], [3160, 3169, "Concept"], [3724, 3733, "Concept"], [1324, 1328, "Concept"], [1677, 1681, "Concept"], [2576, 2580, "Concept"], [2723, 2727, "Concept"], [3196, 3200, "Concept"], [3356, 3360, "Concept"], [1385, 1399, "Concept"], [2646, 2660, "Concept"], [3252, 3266, "Concept"], [2107, 2120, "Concept"], [1231, 1248, "Concept"], [1278, 1295, "Concept"], [1714, 1731, "Concept"], [1481, 1486, "Concept"], [1517, 1522, "Concept"], [1495, 1504, "Concept"], [1552, 1561, "Concept"], [4921, 4935, "Concept"]]}
