Sequences and Summations
l Specifying and recognizing sequences
l Summation notation
l Closed forms of summations
l Cardinality of infinite sets

Sequences are ordered lists of elements
Definition: A sequence is a function from a subset of
the set of integers to a set S. We use the notation an
to denote the image of the integer n. an is called a
term of the sequence.

Examples:
l 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11
l 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, …

A sequence with 6 terms
An infinite sequence

Note: The second example can be described as the
sequence {an} where an = 1/n

What makes sequences so special?
Question: Aren’t sequences just sets?
Answer: The elements of a sequence are members of a
set, but a sequence is ordered, a set is not.

Question: How are sequences different from ordered
n-tuples?
Answer: An ordered n-tuple is ordered, but always
contains n elements. Sequences can be infinite!

Some special sequences
Geometric progressions are sequences of the form
{arn} where a and r are real numbers

Examples:
l 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, …
l 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, …

a = 1, r = ½
a = 1, r = -1

Arithmetic progressions are sequences of the form
{a + nd} where a and d are real numbers.

Examples:
l 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, …
l -10, -15, -20, -25, …

a = 2, d = 2
a = -10, d = -5

Sometimes we need to figure out the formula for a
sequence given only a few terms
Questions to ask yourself:
1. Are there runs of the same value?
2. Are terms obtained by multiplying the previous value by a
particular amount? (Possible geometric sequence)
3. Are terms obtained by adding a particular amount to the
previous value? (Possible arithmetic sequence)
4. Are terms obtained by combining previous terms in a
certain way?
5. Are there cycles amongst terms?

What are the formulas for these sequences?
Problem 1: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, …
l Arithmetic sequence with a = 1, d = 4

Problem 2: 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, …
l Geometric sequence with a = 1, r = 3

Problem 3: 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, …
l Sequence in which the nth prime number is listed n times

Problem 4: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, …
l Each term is the sum of the two previous terms
This is called the Fibonacci sequence.

Sometimes we want to find the sum of the terms
in a sequence
Summation notation lets us compactly
represent the sum of terms am + am+1 + … + an

Example: ∑1≤i≤5 i2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 55

Constant factors can be pulled out of the
summation
A summation over a sum (or difference) can be split into a
sum (or difference) of smaller summations

Example:
l ∑1≤j≤3 (4j + j2) = (4+1) + (8+4) + (12+9) = 38
l 4∑1≤j≤3 j + ∑1≤j≤3 j2 = 4(1+2+3) + (1+4+9) = 38

Example sums
Example: Express the sum of the first 50 terms of the
sequence 1/n2 for n = 1, 2, 3, …
Answer:

Example: What is the value of
Answer:

We can also compute the summation of the
elements of some set
Example: Compute
Answer: (0 + 2) + (2 + 2) + (4 + 2) + (6 + 2) = 20

Example: Let f(x) = x3 + 1. Compute
Answer: f(1) + f(3) + f(5) + f(7) = 2 + 28 + 126 + 344 = 500

Sometimes it is helpful to shift the index of a
summation
This is particularly useful when combining two or more
summations. For example:
Let j = k - 1

Need to add 1
to each j

Summations can be nested within one another
Often, you’ll see this when analyzing nested loops
within a program (i.e., CS 1501/1502)
Expand inner sum

Example: Compute
Solution:
Simplify if possible

Expand outer sum

Computing the sum of a geometric series by
hand is time consuming…
Would you really want to calculate

by hand?

Fortunately, we have a closed-form solution for
computing the sum of a geometric series:

So,

Why?

We can use the notion of sequences to analyze
the cardinality of infinite sets
Definition: Two sets A and B have the same cardinality
if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence (a
bijection) from A to B.

Definition: A finite set or a set that has the same
cardinality as the natural numbers (or the positive
integers) is called countable. A set that is not
countable is called uncountable.
Implication: Any sequence {an} ranging over the natural
numbers is countable.

Show that the set of even positive integers is countable

Proof #1 (Graphical): We have the following 1-to-1
correspondence between the positive integers and the
even positive integers:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 …
2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 …
So, the even positive integers are countable. ❏

Proof #2: We can define the even positive integers as
the sequence {2k} for all k ∈ Z+, so it has the same
cardinality as Z+, and is thus countable. ❏

Is the set of all rational numbers countable?
Perhaps surprisingly, yes!

This yields the sequence 1/1, 1/2, 2/1, 3/1, 1/3, …, so the
set of rational numbers is countable. ❏

Is the set of real numbers countable?
No, it is not. We can prove this using a proof method called
diagonalization, invented by Georg Cantor.

Proof: Assume that the set of real numbers is countable. Then
the subset of real numbers between 0 and 1 is also countable, by
definition. This implies that the real numbers can be listed in
some order, say, r1, r2, r3 ….
Let the decimal representation these numbers be:
r1 = 0.d11d12d13d14…
r2 = 0.d21d22d23d24…
r3 = 0.d31d32d33d34…
…
Where dij ∈ {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} ∀i,j

Proof (continued)
Now, form a new decimal number r=0.d1d2d3… where di = 0 if dii =
1, and di=1 otherwise.
Example:
r1 = 0.123456…
r2 = 0.234524…
r3 = 0.631234…
…
r = 0.010…
Note that the ith decimal place of r differs from the ith decimal
place of each ri, by construction. Thus r is not included in the list
of all real numbers between 0 and 1. This is a contradiction of
the assumption that all real numbers between 0 and 1 could be
listed. Thus, not all real numbers can be listed, and R is
uncountable. ❏
