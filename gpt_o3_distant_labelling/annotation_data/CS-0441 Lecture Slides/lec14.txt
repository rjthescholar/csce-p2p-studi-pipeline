Lecture #14: Strong Induction

Based on materials developed by Dr. Adam Lee

Recall that mathematical induction let us prove
universally quantified statements
Goal: Prove ∀x∈N P(x).

Intuition: If P(0) is true, then
P(1) is true. If P(1) is true, then
P(2) is true…

Procedure:
1. Prove P(0)
2. Show that P(k) → P(k+1) for any arbitrary k
3. Conclude that P(x) is true ∀x∈N

P(0)
P(k) → P(k+1)
∴∀x∈N P(x)

Strong mathematical induction is another flavor
of induction
Goal: Prove ∀x∈N P(x).
Procedure:
1. Prove P(0)
2. Show that [P(0) ∧ P(1) ∧ … ∧ P(k) ] → P(k+1) for any
arbitrary k
3. Conclude that P(x) is true ∀x∈N

P(0)
[P(0) ∧ P(1) ∧ … ∧ P(k) ] → P(k+1)
∴∀x∈N P(x)

So what’s the big deal?
Recall: In mathematical induction, our inductive
hypothesis allows us to assume that P(k) is true and use
this knowledge to prove P(k+1)
However, in strong induction, we can assume that P(0) ∧
P(1) ∧ … ∧ P(k) is true before trying to prove P(k+1)
For certain types of proofs, this is much easier than
trying to prove P(k+1) from P(k) alone.

For example…

Show that if n is an integer greater than 1, then n can
be written as the product of primes
P(n) ≡ n can be written as a product of primes
Base case: P(2): 2 = 21

✔

I.H.: Assume that P(2) ∧ … ∧ P(k) holds for an arbitrary k
Inductive step: We will now show that [P(2) ∧ … ∧ P(k)] → P(k+1)
n Two cases to consider: k+1 prime and k+1 composite
n If k+1 is prime, then we’re done
n If k+1 is composite, then by definition, k+1 = ab
n Since 2 ≤ a ≤ k and 2 ≤ b ≤ k, a and b can be written as
products of primes by the I.H.
n Thus, k+1 can be written as a product of primes
Conclusion: Since we have proved the base case and the inductive
case, the claim holds by strong induction ❏

Is strong induction somehow more powerful than
mathematical induction?
The ability to assume P(0) ∧ P(1) ∧ … ∧ P(k) true before
proving P(k+1) seems more powerful than just assuming
P(k) is true
Perhaps surprisingly, mathematical induction, strong
induction, and well ordering are all equivalent!
That is, a proof using one of these methods can always
be written using the other two methods

This may not be easy, though!

Prove that every amount of postage of 12 cents or more can be
formed using just 4-cent and 5-cent stamps
P(n) ≡ n cents of postage can be made using 4- and 5-cent stamps
Base case: P(12): 3 4-cent stamps
P(13): 1 5-cent stamp, 2 4-cent stamps
P(14): 2 5-cent stamps, 1 4-cent stamp
P(15): 3 5-cent stamps

✔

I.H.: Assume that P(12) ∧ … ∧ P(k) holds for an arbitrary integer k
Inductive step: We will now show that [P(12) ∧ … ∧ P(k)] → P(k+1)
n By the I.H., we can make k-3 cents worth of postage using
only 4-cent and 5-cent stamps
n By adding another 4-cent stamp, we end up with k+1 cents
worth of postage
Conclusion: Since we have proved the base case and the inductive
case, the claim holds by strong induction ❏

Prove that every amount of postage of 12 cents or more can be
formed using just 4-cent and 5-cent stamps
P(n) ≡ n cents of postage can be made using 4- and 5-cent stamps
Base case: P(12): 3 4-cent stamps ✔
I.H.: Assume that P(k) holds for an arbitrary integer k
Inductive step: We will now show that P(k) → P(k+1)
n We can k cents using 4- and 5-cent stamps, by the I.H.
n If at least one 4-cent stamp was used, remove that stamp and
add in a 5-cent stamp, thereby making k+1 cents of postage
n If no 4-cent stamps were used, then only 5-cent stamps were
used.
n Since k > 12, at least 3 5-cent stamps were used.
n Replace 3 5-cent stamps with 4 4-cent stamps, thereby making
k+1 cents of postage
Conclusion: Since we have proved the base case and the inductive
case, the claim holds by mathematical induction ❏

So when should we use strong induction?
If it is straightforward to prove P(k+1) from P(k) alone,
use mathematical induction
P(0)

P(1)

…

P(k-1)

P(k)

P(k+1)

If it would be easier to prove P(k+1) using one or more
P(j) for 0 ≤ j < k, use strong induction
P(0)

P(1)

…

P(k-1)

P(k)

?

P(k+1)

In-class exercises
Problem 1: Use strong induction to prove that any
whole dollar amount greater than or equal to $4 can
be formed using only $2 and $5 bills.

In-class exercises
Problem 2: Suppose you have a box of Maltesers
containing 𝑛 candies, and you want to split it into 𝑛 piles
of 1 candy each by repeatedly splitting a pile into two
smaller piles. Each time you split a pile, you multiply the
number of candies in each of the two smaller piles you
form, and add it to a running total. For example, if you
split a pile of 13 candies into two piles of size 4 and 9,
you would add 4×9 = 36 to the total.
Show that, no matter how you split the piles, the sum of
! !"#
the products computed at each step will equal

Final Thoughts
n Strong induction lets us prove universally quantified
statements using this inference rule:
P(0)
[P(0) ∧ P(1) ∧ … ∧ P(k) ] → P(k+1)
∴∀x∈N P(x)

n Although sometimes more convenient than mathematical
induction, strong induction is no more powerful
