We can model these types of real-life situations
by relaxing our model of probability
As before, let S be our sample space. Unlike before,
we will allow S to be either finite or countable.
We will require that the following conditions hold:
1. 0 ≤ p(s) ≤ 1 for each s ∈ S
2.

No event can have a negative likelihood of
occurrence, or more than a 100% chance
of occurence

In any given experiment, some event will
occur

The function p : S → [0,1] is called a probability
distribution

Recap our formulas for the probability of
combinations of events
Property 1: p(E) = 1 – p(E)

S=

E

l Recall that S = E ∪ E for any event E
l Further, ∑!∈# 𝑝 𝑠 = 1
l So, p(S) = p(E) + p(E) = 1
l Thus, p(E) = 1 – p(E)

E

Property 2: p(E1 ∪ E2) = p(E1) + p(E2) – p(E1 ∩ E2)
l Recall that 𝑝 𝐸 = ∑!∈$ 𝑝 𝑠
S=
l Let x be some outcome in E1 ∪ E2
l If x is in one of E1 or E2, then p(x) is counted
once on the RHS of the equation
l If x is in both E1 or E2, then p(x) is counted
1 + 1 – 1 = 1 times on the RHS of the equation

A formula for the probability of pairwise disjoint events
Theorem: If E1, E2, …, En is a sequence of pairwise disjoint events in
a sample space S, then we have:
$

$

𝑝 # 𝐸! = & 𝑝 𝐸!

!"#

Recall: E1, E2, …, En are pairwise disjoint iff Ei ∩ Ej = ∅ for 1 ≤ i,j ≤ n
S=
E1

E2

…

En

We can prove this theorem using mathematical induction!

How can we incorporate prior knowledge?
Sometimes we want to know the probability of some event given
that another event has occurred.

Example: A fair coin is flipped three times. The first flip turns
up tails. Given this information, what is the probability that an
odd number of tails appear in the three flips?

Solution:
l Let F = “the first flip of three comes up tails”
l Let E = “tails comes up an odd number of times in three flips”
l Since F has happened, S is reduced to {THH, THT, TTH, TTT}
l We know:
l p(E) = |E|/|S|
l
= |{THH, TTT}| / |{THH, THT, TTH, TTT}|
l
= 2/4
l
= 1/2

Conditional Probability
Definition: Let E and F be events with p(F) > 0. The conditional
probability of E given F, denoted p(E | F), is defined as:

𝑝 𝐸∩𝐹
𝑝 𝐸 𝐹 =
𝑝 𝐹

Intuition:
l Think of the event F as reducing the sample space that can be considered
l The numerator looks at the likelihood of the outcomes in E that overlap
those in F
l The denominator accounts for the reduction in sample size indicated by our
prior knowledge that F has occurred

Bit strings
Example: Suppose that a bit string of length 4 is generated at
random so that each of the 16 possible 4-bit strings is equally
likely to occur. What is the probability that it contains at least
two consecutive 0s, given that the first bit in the string is a 0?

Solution:
l Let E = “A 4-bit string has at least two consecutive zeros”
l Let F = “The first bit of a 4-bit string is a zero”
l Want to calculate p(E | F) = p(E ∩ F)/p(F)
l E ∩ F = {0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100}
l So, p(E ∩ F) = 5/16
l Since each bit string is equally likely to occur,
p(F) = 8/16 = 1/2
l So p(E | F) = (5/16)/(1/2) = 10/16 = 5/8

Kids
Example: What is the conditional probability that a family with
two kids has two boys, given that they have at least one boy?
Assume that each of the possibilities BB, BG, GB, GG is equally
likely to occur.
Boy is older

Solution:
l Let E = “A family with 2 kids has 2 boys”
l E = {BB}
l Let F = “A family with 2 kids has at least 1 boy”
l F = {BB, BG, GB}
l E ∩ F = {BB}
l So p(E | F) = p(E ∩ F)/p(F)
l
l

= (1/4) / (3/4)
= 1/3

Girl is older

Does prior knowledge always help us?
Example: Suppose a fair coin is flipped twice. Does knowing that
the coin comes up tails on the first flip help you predict whether
the coin will be tails on the second flip?

Solution:
l S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}
l F = “Coin was tails on the first flip” = {TH, TT}
l E = “Coin is tails on the second flip” = {TT, HT}
l p(E) = 2/4 = 1/2
l p(E | F) = p(E ∩ F)/p(F)
l
= (1/4) / (2/4)
l
= 1/2
l Knowing the first flip does not help you guess the second flip!

Independent Events
Definition: We say that events E and F are independent if and
only if p(E ∩ F) = p(E)p(F).

Recall: In our last example…
l S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}
l F = {TH, TT}
l E = {HT, TT}
l E ∩ F = {TT}

So:
l p(E ∩ F) = |E ∩ F|/|S|
l
= 1/4
l p(E)p(F) = 1/2 × 1/2
l
= 1/4

This checks out!

Example: Bit Strings
Example: Suppose that E is the event that a randomly generated
bit string of length four begins with a 1, and F is the event that
this bit string contains an even number of 1s. Are E and F
independent if all 4-bit strings are equally likely to occur?

Solution:
l By the product rule, |S| = 24 = 16
l E = {1111, 1110, 1101, 1011, 1100, 1010, 1001, 1000}
l F = {0000, 0011, 0101, 0110, 1001, 1010, 1100, 1111}
l So p(E) = p(F) = 8/16 = 1/2
l p(E)p(F) = 1/4
l E ∩ F = {1111, 1100, 1010, 1001}
l p(E ∩ F) = 4/16 = 1/4
l Since p(E ∩ F) = p(E)p(F), E and F are independent events

Example: Distribution of kids
Example: Assume that each of the four ways that a family can
have two children are equally likely. Are the events E that a
family with two children has two boys, and F that a family with
two children has at least one boy independent?

Solution:
l E = {BB}
l F = {BB, BG, GB}
l p(E) = 1/4
l p(F) = 3/4
l p(E)p(F) = 3/16
l E ∩ F = {BB}
l p(E ∩ F) = 1/4
l Since 1/4 ≠ 3/16, E and F are not independent

If probabilities are independent, we can use the product rule to
determine the probabilities of combinations of events
Example: What is the probability of flipping heads 4 times in a
row using a fair coin?

Answer: p(H) = 1/2, so p(HHHH) = (1/2)4 = 1/16

Example: What is the probability of rolling the same number 3
times in a row using an unbiased 6-sided die?

Answer:
l
l
l
l

First roll agrees with itself with probability 1
2nd roll agrees with first with probability 1/6
3rd roll agrees with first two with probability 1/6
So probability of rolling the same number 3 times is 1 × 1/6 × 1/6 = 1/36

Many experiments only have two outcomes

P(x)
Coin flips: Heads or tails?

Bit strings: 0 or 1?

Predicates: T or F?

These types of experiments are called Bernoulli trials
Two outcomes:
l Success
l Failure

Probability p
Probability q = 1 – p

Many problems can be solved by examining the probability of k
successes in an experiment consisting of mutuallyindependent Bernoulli trials

Example: Coin flips
Example: A coin is biased so that the probability of heads is 2/3.
What is the probability that exactly four heads come up when the
coin is flipped seven times, assuming that each flip is independent?

Solution:
l 27 = 128 possible outcomes for seven flips
l There are C(7,4) ways that heads can be flipped four times
l Since each flip is independent, the probability of each of these outcomes is
(2/3)4(1/3)3
l So, the probability of exactly 4 heads occurring in 7 flips of this biased coin
is C(7,4)(2/3)4(1/3)3 = 560/2187

This general reasoning provides us with a nice formula…
Theorem: The probability of exactly k successes in n independent
Bernoulli trials, with probability of success p and probability of
failure q = 1-p, is C(n,k)pkqn-k.

Proof:
l The outcome of n Bernoulli trials is an n-tuple (t1, t2, …, tn)
l Each ti is either S (for success) or F (for failure)
l C(n,k) ways to choose k tis to label S
l Since each trial is independent, the probability of each outcome with k
successes and n-k failures is pkqn-k
l So, the probability of exactly k successes is C(n,k)pkqn-k. ❏

Notation: We denote the probability of k successes in n independent
Bernoulli trials with probability of success p as b(k; n, p).

Bits (Again)
Example: Suppose that the probability that a 0 bit is generated is
0.9, that the probability that a 1 bit is generated is 0.1, and that
bits are generated independently. What is the probability that
exactly eight 0 bits are generated when ten random bits are
generated?

Solution:
l Number of trials
l Number of successes
l Probability of success
l Probability of failure
l Want to compute b(k; 10, 0.9)
l
= C(10, 8)0.980.12
l
= 0.1937102445

n = 10
k=8
p = 0.9
q = 1 – 0.9 = 0.1

Many probability questions are concerned with some
numerical value associated with an experiment

Number of boys in a family
Number of 1 bits generated

Beats per minute of a heart

Longevity of a chicken

Number of “heads” flips

What is a random variable?
Definition: A random variable is a function X from the sample
space of an experiment to the set of real numbers R. That is, a
random variable assigns a real number to each possible outcome.

Note: Despite the name, X is not a variable,
and is not random. X is a function!

Example: Suppose that a coin is flipped three times. Let X(s) be
the random variable that equals the numbers of heads that
appear when s is the outcome. Then X(s) takes the following
values:
l X(HHH) = 3
l X(HHT) = X(HTH) = X(THH) = 2
l X(TTH) = X(THT) = X(HTT) = 1
l X(TTT) = 0

Random variables and distributions
Definition: The distribution of a random variable X on a sample
space S is the set of pairs (r, p(X=r)) for all r ∈ X(S), where p(X=r)
is the probability that X takes the value r.
Note: A distribution is usually described by specifying p(X=r) for
each r ∈ X(S)

Example: Assume that our coin flips from the previous slide were
all equally likely to occur. We then get the following distribution
for the random variable X:
l p(X=0) = 1/8
l p(X=1) = 3/8
l p(X=2) = 3/8
l p(X=3) = 1/8

Example: Rolling dice
Let X be the sum of the numbers that appear when a pair of fair dice
is rolled. What are the values of this random variable for the 36
possible outcomes (i, j) where i and j are the numbers that appear on
the first and second die, respectively?

Answer:
l X(1,1) = 2
l X(1,2) = X(2, 1) = 3
l X(1,3) = X(2,2) = X(3,1) = 4
l X(1,4) = X(2,3) = X(3,2) = X(4,1) = 5
l X(1,5) = X(2,4) = X(3,3) = X(4,2) = X(5,1) = 6
l X(1,6) = X(2,5) = X(3,4) = X(4,3) = X(5,2) = X(6,1) = 7
l X(2,6) = X(3,5) = X(4,4) = X(5,3) = X(6,2) = 8
l X(3,6) = X(4,5) = X(5,4) = X(6,3) = 9
l X(4,6) = X(5,5) = X(6,4) = 10
l X(5,6) = X(6,5) = 11
l X(6,6) = 12

p(X=2) = 1/36
p(X=3) = 2/36
p(X=4) = 3/36
p(X=5) = 4/36
p(X=6) = 5/36
p(X=7) = 6/36
p(X=8) = 5/36
p(X=9) = 4/36
p(X=10) = 3/36
p(X=11) = 2/36
p(X=12) = 1/36

Sometimes probabilistic reasoning can lead us to some
interesting and unexpected conclusions…
Question: How many people need to be in the same room so that
the probability of two people sharing the same birthday is greater
than 1/2?

Assumptions:
1. There are 366 possible birthdays
2. All birthdays are equally likely to occur
3. Birthdays are independent

Solution tactic:
l Find the probability pn that the n people in a room all have
different birthdays
l Then compute 1-pn, which is the probability that at least two
people share the same birthday

Let’s figure this out…
Let’s assess probabilities as people enter the room
l Person 1 clearly doesn’t have the same birthday as anyone else in the
room
l P2 has a different birthday than P1 with probability 365/366
l P3 has a different birthday than P1 and P2 with probability 364/366
l …

In general, Pj has a different birthday than P1, P2, …, Pj-1 with
probability [366-(j-1)]/366 = (367-j)/366
Recall that pn is the probability that n people in the room all have
different birthdays. Using our above observations, this means:

But we’re interested in 1-pn …

To check the minimum number of people need in the room to
ensure that pn > 1/2, we’ll use trial and error:
l If n = 22, then 1 – pn ≈ 0.475
l If n = 23, then 1 – pn ≈ 0.506

So, you need only 23 people in a room to have a better than 50%
chance that two people share the same birthday!

In-class exercises

n Next time:
l Bayes’ Theorem (Section 7.3)

The proof…
P(n) ≡ 𝑝 ⋃$!"# 𝐸! = ∑$!"# 𝑝 𝐸!
Base case: P(2): Let E1, E2 be disjoint events.
By definition, p(E1 ∪ E2) = p(E1) + p(E2) – p(E1 ∩ E2).
Since E1 ∩ E2 = ∅, p(E1 ∪ E2) = p(E1) + p(E2)
I.H.: Assume that P(k) holds for an arbitrary integer k
Inductive step: We will now show that P(k) → P(k+1)
n Consider E = E1 ∪ E2 ∪ … ∪ Ek ∪ Ek+1
n Let J = E1 ∪ E2 ∪ … ∪ Ek, so E = J ∪ Ek+1
n p(E) = p(J ∪ Ek+1)
n
= p(J) ∪ p(Ek+1)
n
= p(E1 ∪ E2 ∪ … ∪ Ek) ∪ p(Ek+1)
n
= p(E1) ∪ p(E2) ∪ … ∪ p(Ek) ∪ p(Ek+1)

by definition of E

Conclusion: Since we have proved the base case and the inductive
case, the claim holds by mathematical induction ❏
