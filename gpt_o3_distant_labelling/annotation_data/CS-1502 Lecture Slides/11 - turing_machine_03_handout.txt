Combining Turing Machines

A Turing machine represents an algorithm
Generally an algorithm can be described as a number of
smaller algorithms working in combination
Similarly, we can combine several Turing machines into a
larger one
Example, two Turing machines T1 and T2 sharing the same
tape:
When T1 finishes (either in the accept or reject state), T2
takes over
This new machine is represented by T1 T2

, qaccept
, qreject

)
T2 = (Q2 , Σ, Γ, δ2 , qstart , qaccept , qreject

Let T = (Q, Σ, Γ, δ, qstart , qaccept , qreject ) be T1 T2 which can
be constructed as follows:
Q = Q1 ∪ Q2 (states of T2 are relabeled if necessary)

Initial state of T is the initial state of T1 (qstart = qstart
)

δ = δ1 ∪ δ2 except those of T1 that go to qaccept and qreject

A transition
in T1 becomes

where qa is the accept state of T1 and qs is the start state of
T2

If T1 enter its accept state, T2 takes over. The moves that
cause T to accept are precisely those that case T2 to accept
However, if T1 enter the reject state and halt, so does T

Example

Suppose we want to create a machine that recognize a
palindrome (e.g., racecar)
Suppose we have the following Turing machines:
Copy: From tx to txtx
NB : Moves tape head to the next blank symbol to the right
PB : Moves tape head to the next blank symbol to the left
R: Reverses the content of the tape from tx to txr
xr is the reverse of a string x

Equal : Compare two strings separated by a blank symbol

For simplicity, we put the blank symbol on the first square of
the tape to indicate the left-end of the tape.

All tape heads can read then write and move in a single

Multitape Turing Machines
Transition function need to control/make decision based on
symbols read from all tapes
Example: A transition function of a three-tape TM:
δ(q, x, y, z) → (r, a, b, c, R, L, R)
Current state is q, the first tape reads x, the second tape reads
y, and the third tape reads z
Change the current state to r
Write a on to the first tape, write b onto the second tape, and
write c onto the third tape
Move the first tape head to the right direction, move the
second tape head to the left direction, and move the third tape
head to the right direction

Multitape TMs are suitable for algorithms in which several
kinds of data are involved

Use x to indicate the current position of each tape head
One move of multitape machine will be equal to several moves
of one-tape machine
For example,

will be

Move to the next • on the right, write 0, move to the left
square, write • over the symbol, and move to the right square
Move to the next • on the right, write b, move to the left
square, write • over the symbol, and move to the right square
Move to the next • on the right, write b, move to the right
square, write • over the symbol, and move to the left-end

From the above multi-tape TM, if the second tape head needs
to move tot he right direction, it should be on top of a blank
symbol
But on a single-tape TM, it will be on top of the # symbol
Single-tape TM must insert the blank symbol with a dot at
the #

Every multitape TM has an equivalent single-tape TM
(slower)

Nondeterministic Turing Machine
Similar to Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA)
Processing one input symbol results in one or more machine.
δ : Q × Γ → P(Q × Γ × {L, R})
Computation is a tree similar to NFA

For a nondeterministic Turing machine (NTM):
If a branch is in the accept state, the machine accepts the
input string
If all branches are in the reject state, the machine rejects the
input string
If no branch is in the accept state and at least one branch
enter an infinite loop, the machine loops indefinitely on the
input string

Theorem 3.16
Every nondeterministic Turing machine has an equivalent
deterministic Turing machine.

with L(T ) = L(T ).

Recall that δ : Q × Γ → P(Q × Γ × {L, R})
Processing a tape alphabet at a state may result in multiple
machines
The upper bound of the number of machines is
|Q| × |Γ| × |{L, R}|
For simplicity, assume that for every combination of nonhalting
state and tape symbol, there are exactly two moves (split to
two machines)

The branch in blue behaves like a deterministic TM
The move follows the path in blue can be represented by 0110
Use 0110 as a guideline to simulate a branch

Turing Machine 03

Proof Idea
Suppose a deterministic TM picks a branch and simulate it
If that branch ends in the accept state, the NTM accepts the
input string
If that branch ends in the reject state, no conclusion
If another branch is in the accept state, NTM accepts the
input string
If all other branches are in the reject state, NTM rejects the
input string
If no branch is in the accept state and at least one branch
enter infinite loop, NTM loops indefinitely on the input string

If that branch enter infinite loop, the simulation will not end
We do not always know that a TM has enter an infinite loop
Even if we know that it enters an infinite loop, we still cannot
conclude whether NTM accepts or rejects the input string

Machine T 0 that simulate an NTM will have to test all
possible moves (level order, breadth first search)

Thumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu

Turing Machine 03

Proof Idea
Machine T 0 consists of four tapes
Tape 1 will be the input string and its contents never change
Tape 2 contain the binary string that represents the sequence
of moves we are currently testing. (e.g., 0110t)
Tape 3 is the working tape of a copy of NTM
Tape 4 keeps track of all possible reject sequences

If a sequence of moves result in the accept state, T 0 accepts
the input string
If all possible sequence of the same length end in the reject
state, T 0 rejects the input string
If NTM loops indefinitely on the input string, the simulation
will also loop indefinitely
Since T 0 is a multitape Turing machine, there is an equivalent
single-tape Turing machine

Thumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu

Turing Machine 03

Universal Turing Machine
A universal TM is a TM that can run another TM on an input
string
Imagine a multi-tape TM:
Tape 1 contains the formal definition of a TM M , followed by
a # symbol, and an input string w
Tape 2 will be a working tape for TM M
Tape 3 will be used to keep track of the current state of TM M

Initially:
Copy input string w to tape 2
Put the start state of TM M onto tape 3

To run a step, simply search for δ(q, a) in the formal definition
of TM M
q is the current state of tape 3
a is the symbol under the second tape head

and update tapes 2 and 3 until tape 3 contains qaccept or
qreject
A universal TM will loop indefinitely if the TM that it is
running loop indefinitely

The Church-Turing Thesis

To say that the Turing machine is a general model of
computation means that any algorithmic procedure that can
be carried out at all, by a human computer or a team of
humans or an electronic computer, can be carried out by a
Turing machine.
Note that a Turing machine depends on low-level operations
A complex algorithm is simply a series of simple instruction
(e.g., assembly) that involve
sophisticated logic (state machine) or
complex bookkeeping (tape/memory) strategies

An algorithm is a procedure that can be carried out by a
Turing machine.
