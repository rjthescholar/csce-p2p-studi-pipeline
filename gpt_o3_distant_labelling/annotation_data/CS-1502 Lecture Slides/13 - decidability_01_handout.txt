Decidability

A language is decidable if there is a decider decides it
A language is a set of strings
A decider is a Turing machine that halts on all inputs
A Turing machine halts when it enters either the accept state
(qaccept ) or the reject state (qreject )
To show that a language A is decidable:
Construct a TM M that you think it decides the language A
and prove that
1
2

For every s ∈ A, M must accept s and
For every s 6∈ A, M must reject s

Decidability

We constructed M and proved that
1
2

For every s ∈ A, M must accept s and
For every s 6∈ A, M must reject s

This allows us to conclude the following:
1

L(M ) = A
M accepts all strings in A and does not accept all strings not
in A

2

M is a decider (always halts)
Given a string s, it is either in A or not in A
If s ∈ A, M accepts s (halts)
If s 6∈ A, M rejects s (halts)

3

A is decidable
The decider M decides A

Problem
The problem of determining whether a DFA accepts a string.
Let hxi be a string representation of the object x
The above problem can be converted into a membership
problem (language) ADFA
ADFA = {hB, wi | B is a DFA that accepts input string w}
Now, the problem whether DFA B accepts the string w
becomes the problem whether hB, wi is in ADFA

The language ADFA
ADFA = {hB, wi | B is a DFA that accepts input string w}
About the above language:
If F is a DFA and it accepts 01101, hF, 01101i is in ADFA
hF, 01101i can be the formal definition of DFA F , followed by
#, and followed by 01101
hF, 01101i = "({q0 , . . . }, {0, 1}, . . . )#01101"

If G is a DFA and it rejects ε, hG, εi is not in ADFA

Recall a set definition defined by a predicate:
What can we conclude if hB, wi ∈ ADFA ?
B is a DFA that accepts input string w

What can we conclude if hB, wi 6∈ ADFA ?
B is not a DFA,
w is not a string, or
B is a DFA that rejects input string w

The language ADFA
ADFA = {hB, wi | B is a DFA that accepts input string w}

If hB, wi ∈ ADFA (DFA B accepts the string w), M accepts
hB, wi
If hB, wi 6∈ ADFA (DFA B rejects the string w), M rejects

The language ADFA
ADFA = {hB, wi | B is a DFA that accepts input string w}
An example of a Turing machine M is as follows:
M =“On input hB, wi, where B is a DFA and w is a string:

2

Simulate B on input w.
If the simulation ends in an accept state, accept. If it ends in a
nonaccepting state, reject.”

Notes about the above TM
Input format hB, wi is the same as format of strings in ADFA
The where clause filters out the following cases:
B is not a DFA

Is M a Decider for the Language ADFA
Again, to show that the Turing machine M is a decider for
the language ADFA , we have to show that
1
2

If hB, wi ∈ ADFA , M accepts w
If hB, wi 6∈ ADFA , M rejects w

Proofs:
Case 1: Assume that hB, wi ∈ ADFA . Since hB, wi ∈ ADFA ,
by the definition of ADFA , B is a DFA that accepts the string
w. Since B accepts w, by simulating B on input w in step 1,
the simulation will end in an accept state. Since the simulation
ends in an accept state, M accepts hB, wi.
Case 2: Assume that hB, wi 6∈ ADFA . Since hB, wi 6∈ ADFA ,
by the definition of ADFA , B is a DFA that rejects the string
w. Since B rejects w, by simulating B on input w in step 1,
the simulation will end in a non-accept state. Since the
simulation ends in a non-accept state, M rejects hB, wi.

We just show that M accepts all strings in ADFA and rejects
all strings not in ADFA
M is a decider for ADFA . Therefore, ADFA is decidable

Prove that ADFA is Decidable
Prove that
ADFA = {hB, wi | B is a DFA that accepts w}
is decidable.
Solution: Construct a TM M as follows:
M =“On input hB, wi, where B is a DFA and w is a string:
1

Simulate B on input w.

2

If the simulation ends in an accept state, accept. If it ends in a nonaccepting
state, reject.”

Next, we need to prove that M decides ADFA :
Case 1: Assume that hB, wi ∈ ADFA . Since hB, wi ∈ ADFA , by the definition
of ADFA , B is a DFA that accepts the string w. Since B accepts w, by
simulating B on input w in step 1, the simulation will end in an accept state.
Since the simulation ends in an accept state, M accepts hB, wi.
Case 2: Assume that hB, wi 6∈ ADFA . Since hB, wi 6∈ ADFA , by the definition
of ADFA , B is a DFA that rejects the string w. Since B rejects w, by
simulating B on input w in step 1, the simulation will end in a non-accept state.
Since the simulation ends in a non-accept state, M rejects hB, wi.
This shows that M is a decider for ADFA . Therefore, ADFA is decidable.

ANFA
Let ANFA = {hB, wi | B is an NFA that accepts input string w}.
Show that ANFA is decidable.
Again, to show that ANFA is decidable, we need to construct
a TM N and prove the following:
1
2

If hB, wi ∈ ANFA , N accepts hB, wi
If hB, wi 6∈ ANFA , N rejects hB, wi

As discussed earlier in Chapter 1, there is an algorithm that
allows us convert an NFA B into an equivalent DFA C
Since there is an algorithm, a Turing machine that convert an
NFA B into a equivalent DFA C where L(B) = L(C)
If NFA B accepts w, DFA C also accepts w
If DFA C accepts w, hC, wi ∈ ADFA
If hC, wi ∈ ADFA , TM M (decider for ADFA ) accept hC, wi

3

Convert NFA B to an equivalent DFA C, using the procedure
for this conversion given in Theorem 1.39.
Run TM M from Theorem 4.1 on input hC, wi.
If M accepts, accept; otherwise, reject.”

Notes about TM N
Recall that the language of TM M is ADFA :
ADFA = {hB, wi | B is a DFA that accepts w}
TM N runs TM M on input hC, wi where
C is a DFA that it just constructed from NFA B
w is a string
M will accept or reject hC, wi depending on whether hC, wi
in ADFA

TM N runs TM M on input hB, wi, M will always reject the
input since B is an NFA

Prove that ANFA is Decidable
Prove that ANFA = {hB, wi | B is an NFA that accepts w} is decidable.
Solution: Construct a TM N as follows:
N =“On input hB, wi, where B is a NFA and w is a string:
1

Convert NFA B to an equivalent DFA C, using the procedure for this conversion
given in Theorem 1.39.

2

Run TM M from Theorem 4.1 on input hC, wi.

3

If M accepts hC, wi, accept; otherwise, reject.”

Next, we need to prove that N decides ANFA :
1

Case 1: Assume that hB, wi ∈ ANFA . Since hB, wi ∈ ANFA , by the definition
of the language ANFA , B is an NFA that accepts the string w. By converting
the NFA B into an equivalent DFA C (L(B) = L(C)), C also accepts the string
w. Since C is a DFA that accepts the string w, hC, wi ∈ ADFA . Since M is a
decider for ADFA , by running M on input hC, wi, M will accept hC, wi which
will cause N to accept hB, wi.

2

Case 2: Assume that hB, wi 6∈ ANFA , Since hB, wi 6∈ ANFA , by the definition
of the language ANFA , B is an NFA that rejects the string w. By converting
the NFA B into an equivalent DFA C (L(B) = L(C)), C also rejects the string
w. Since C is a DFA that rejects the string w, hC, wi 6∈ ADFA . Since M is a
decider for ADFA , by running M on input hC, wi, M will reject hC, wi which
will cause N to reject hB, wi.

This shows that TM N is a decider for ANFA . Therefore, ANFA is decidable.

AREX
Let
AREX = {hR, wi | R is a regular expression that generates string w}.

Show that AREX is decidable.
Again, to show that AREX is decidable, we need to construct
a TM P and prove the following:
1
2

If hR, wi ∈ AREX , P accepts hR, wi
If hR, wi 6∈ AREX , P rejects hR, wi

Recall that we have an algorithm that generates an NFA A
from a regular expression R where the language of A is
expressed by R
Again, since there is an algorithm, we can have a Turing
machine that convert a regular expression R into an equivalent
NFA A

Decidability 01

Prove that AREX is Decidable
Prove that AREX = {hR, wi | R is a regular expression that generates string w} is
decidable.
Solution: Construct a TM P as follows:
P =“On input hR, wi, where R is a regular express and w is a string:
1 Convert regular expression R to an equivalent NFA A by using the procedure for
this conversion given in Theorem 1.54.
2 Run TM N from Theorem 4.2 on input hA, wi.
3 If N accepts hA, wi, accept; if N rejects hA, wi, reject.”
Next, we need to prove that P decides AREX :
1 Case 1: Assume that hR, wi ∈ AREX . Since hR, wi ∈ AREX , from the
definition of AREX , R is a regular expression that generates the string w. Since
R is a regular expression that generates w, by converting R into an equivalent
NFA A, A accepts w. Since NFA A accepts w, hA, wi ∈ ANFA . Since TM N is
a decider for ANFA , by running N on input hA, wi, N will accept hA, wi which
causes P to accept hR, wi.
2 Case 2: Assume that hR, wi 6∈ AREX . Since hR, wi 6∈ AREX , from the
definition of AREX , R is a regular expression that does not generate the string
w. Since R is a regular expression that does not generate w, by converting R
into an equivalent NFA A, A rejects w. Since NFA A rejects w,
hA, wi 6∈ ANFA . Since TM N is a decider for ANFA , by running N on input
hA, wi, N will reject hA, wi which causes P to reject hR, wi.
This shows that TM P is a decider for AREX . Therefore, AREX is decidable.
