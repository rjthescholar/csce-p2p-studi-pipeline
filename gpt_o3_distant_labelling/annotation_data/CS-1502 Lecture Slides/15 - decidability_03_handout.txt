Decidability 03

Undecidability
Consider the following language:
ATM = {hM, wi | M is a TM and M accepts w}
Is ATM recognizable?
To show that ATM is recognizable, you need to construct a
TM that accepts all strings in ATM
But if a string is not in ATM , no need to explicitly reject
Loop indefinitely is acceptable

The following is an example of a TM that recognizes ATM :
U =“On input hM, wi, where M is a TM and w is a string:
1
2

Simulate M on input w.
If M ever enters its accept state, accept; if M enters its reject
state, reject.”

ATM = {hM, wi | M is a TM and M accepts w}
The following is an example of a TM that recognizes ATM :
U =“On input hM, wi, where M is a TM and w is a string:
1
2

Simulate M on input w.
If M ever enters its accept state, accept; if M enters its reject
state, reject.”

Let’s look at the above machine:
If hM, wi ∈ ATM :
M is a TM that accepts w
TM U will accept hM, wi

If hM, wi 6∈ ATM :
1

2

M is a TM that rejects w
TM U will reject hM, wi
M is a TM that loops indefinitely on input w
TM U will loop indefinitely on input hM, wi

Decidability 03

Undecidability

TM U accepts all strings in ATM and does not accept
(either rejects or loop indefinitely) on all strings not in ATM
ATM is recognizable

Is ATM decidable?
Unfortunately, ATM is undecidable
But how to prove it?

We will try to prove that it is undecidable later

Unrecognizable Lanugage
Corollary 4.18
Some languages are not Turing-recognizable.
To show that there exists an unrecognizable language, we only
need to find a language that is not recognized by any Turing
machines
It is not not easy to come up with such a language

Note that a Turing machine recognizes only one language
To prove that an unrecognizable language exists, we can
simply show that the number of languages is more than
the number of Turing machines
But we have a problem
There are infinite number of languages
There are infinite number of Turing machines

How do we know which set is larger?

Cantor’s Observation
Cantor observed that two finite sets A and B have the same
size if we can pair one element from A with the element of B
{a, s, d, f}

{a, s, d, f}

{1, 4, 7, 3}

{1, 4, 7, 3}

Pairing #1

Pairing #2

The pairing does not have to be unique
We can consider pairing method as a function f : A → B that
has the following properties:
one-to-one: f (a) 6= f (b) whenever a 6= b
onto: For every b ∈ B there is an a ∈ A such that f (a) = b

Functions that are one-to-one and onto are called bijection or
correspondence

Example
Same Size?
Let N be the set of natural numbers {1, 2, 3, . . . } and let E be the
set of even natural number {2, 4, 6, . . . }. Show that N and E have
the same size.
To show that N and E have the same size, according to the
canter’s observation, we need to show a correspondence
between N and E
A mapping function can be f : N → E where f (n) = 2n

there are infinitely many correspondences

Countable
Definition 4.14
A set A is countable if either it is finite or it has the same size as
N.
To show that an infinite set A is countable, we need to show
that it has the same size as N
To show that an infinite set A has the same size as N, we
need to show a correspondence f : N → A between A and N
Can be a definition of a function (one-to-one and onto)
Can be a table that demonstrates one-to-one and onto

An infinite set B is uncountable if there is no correspondence
with N
An infinite set A is smaller than an infinite set B if A is
countable but B is not countable.

The Set of Integers is Countable

For Z we need to pair elements from both sides of 0
Example
N 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ...
Z 0 1 -1 2 -2 3 -3 . . .
The above correspondence can be represented by a function
f : N → Z where
f (1) = 0

The Set of Positive Rational Numbers is Countable
Let Q be a set of rational numbers:
Q = {m
n | m ∈ N and n ∈ N}
Again, we need to find a correspondence between N and Q
The best starting point is to try to list them all in an order
