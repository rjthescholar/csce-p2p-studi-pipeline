PSUBSETDFA

Question
Prove that
PSUBSETDFA = {hA, Bi|A and B are DFAs and L(A) ⊂ L(B)}
is decidable.
Recall that you need to perform two tasks:
1
2

Construct a TM that you think it decides PSUBSETDFA
Prove that your TM is actually a decider for PSUBSETDFA

Recall L(A) ⊂ L(B) (proper subset)
L(A) 6= L(B) and L(A) is a subset of L(B)

PSUBSETDFA is Decidable

Solution: Construct a TM M 0 to decide PSUBSETDFA as follows:
M 0 =“On input hA, Bi where A and B are DFAs:
1

Run TM F on input hA, Bi

2

If F accepts hA, Bi, reject.

3

Construct a DFA C such that L(C) = L(A) ∩ L(B)

4

Run TM T on input hCi

5

If T accepts hCi, accept. If T rejects hCi, reject.”

Next, we need to prove that the above TM M 0 is a decider for PSUBSETDFA .

PSUBSETTM is Decidable
To show that TM M 0 is a decider for PSUBSETDFA , we need to perform the
following:
Show that if hA, Bi ∈ PSUBSETDFA , M 0 will accept hA, Bi.
Assume that hA, Bi ∈ PSUBSETDFA . Since hA, Bi ∈ PSUBSETDFA , A and B
are DFAs and L(A) is a proper subset of L(B). In other words, L(A) is not
equal to L(B) and L(A) is a subset of L(B). Since L(A) is not equal to L(B),
hA, Bi 6∈ EQDFA . Since F is a decider for EQDFA , by running F on input hA, Bi,
F will reject hA, Bi. Since L(A) is a subset of L(B), L(C) will be empty. Since
L(C) is empty, hCi ∈ EDFA . Since T is a decider for EDFA , by running T on
input hCi, T will accept hCi. Since T accepts hCi, M 0 accepts hA, Bi.
Show that if hA, Bi 6∈ PSUBSETTM , M 0 will reject hA, Bi.
Assume that hA, Bi 6∈ PSUBSETDFA . Since hA, Bi 6∈ PSUBSETDFA , A and B
are DFAs and L(A) is not a proper subset of L(B). In other words,
L(A) = L(B) or L(A) is not a subset of L(B).
Suppose L(A) = L(B). Since L(A) = L(B), hA, Bi ∈ EQDFA . Since F is a
decider for EQDFA , by running F on input hA, Bi, F will accept hA, Bi. Since
F accepts hA, Bi, M 0 rejects hA, Bi.
Suppose L(A) is not a subset of L(B). Since L(A) is not a subset of L(B),
L(C) will not be empty. Since L(C) is not empty, hCi 6∈ EDFA . Since T is a
decider for EDFA , by running T on input hCi, T will reject hCi. Since T rejects
hCi, M 0 rejects hA, Bi.
This shows that M 0 is a decider for PSUBSETDFA DFA. Therefore, PSUBSETDFA is
decidable.

ALLBUTONETM

Question
Prove that
ALLBUTONETM = {hM i|M is a TM that accepts all but one string}

is undecidable. Note that if TM M accepts all but one string,
L(M ) = Σ∗ − {w} for a string w.
Recall that there are two methods:

ALLBUTONETM is Undecidable (Method 1)

Assume that ALLBUTONETM is decidable. Since ALLBUTONETM is decidable, there
exists a TM R that decides ALLBUTONETM . Construct a TM S to decide ATM as
follows:
S =“On input hM, wi where M is a TM and w is a string:
1

Construct a TM M 0 as follows:
M 0 =“On input x:
1
2
3

If x == ε, reject.
Run M on input w.
If M accepts w, accept. If M rejects w, reject.”

2

Run TM R on input hM 0 i.

3

If R accepts hM 0 i, accept. If R rejects hM 0 i, reject.”

Next, we need to show that the above TM S is a decider for ATM .

ALLBUTONETM is Undecidable (Method 1)
To show that TM M 0 is a decider for ALLBUTONETM , we need to perform the
following:
If hM, wi ∈ ATM , S will accept hM, wi.
Assume that hM, wi ∈ ATM . Since hM, wi ∈ ATM , M is a TM that accepts w.
Since M accepts w, from the description of TM M 0 , L(M 0 ) = Σ∗ − {ε}. Since
L(M 0 ) = Σ∗ − {ε}, hM 0 i ∈ ALLBUTONETM . Since R is a decider for
ALLBUTONETM , by running R on input ALLBUTONETM , R will accept hM 0 i.
Since R accepts hM 0 i, S accepts hM, wi.
If hM, wi 6∈ ATM , S will reject hM, wi.
Assume that hM, wi 6∈ ATM . Since hM, wi 6∈ ATM , M is a TM that does not
accept w. Since M does not accept w, from the description of TM M 0 ,
L(M 0 ) = ∅. Since L(M 0 ) = ∅, L(M 0 ) 6= Σ∗ − {w} for a string w. In other
words, hM 0 i 6∈ ALLBUTONETM . Since R is a decider for ALLBUTONETM , by
running R on input ALLBUTONETM , R will reject hM 0 i. Since R rejects hM 0 i,
S rejects hM, wi.
This shows that S is a decider for ATM . In other words ATM is decidable. This
contradicts with the fact that ATM is undecidable. Therefore, ALLBUTONETM is
undecidable.

ALLBUTONETM is Undecidable (Method 2)
Need to show that ATM ≤m ALLBUTONETM . Construct a TM F as follows:
F =“On input hM, wi where M is a TM and w is a string:

Output hM 0 i.

Next, we need to show that the above TM F is a reduction from ATM to
ALLBUTONETM . In other word, we have to show that it satisfies:
hM, wi ∈ ATM ↔ F (hM, wi) ∈ ALLBUTONETM

undecidable, ALLBUTONETM is undecidable.

NOTPRIME

Question
Consider the following language
NOTPRIME = {hni|n is a natural number and n is not a prime number}

Perform the following:
1

Construct a verifier for the language NOTPRIME

2

Construct an NTM that decides NOTPRIME

Thumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu

Review

A Verifier of NOTPRIME
Given a language A, a verifier V of the language A is a TM
satisfying
A = {w | V accepts hw, ci for some c}
From the above description
Given a string w ∈ A, V must accept hw, ci for some c
Given a string w 6∈ A, V must reject hw, ci for all c

A verifier for NOTPRIME must satisfies
NOTPRIME = {hni | V accepts hn, ci for some c}
An example of a verifier for the language NOTPRIME:
V =“On input hn, ci where n and c are natural numbers:
1
2

If c == 1 or c ≥ n, reject.
If n mod c == 0, accept.”

An NTM that decides NOTPRIME

Think about how brute force algorithm should work
Generate all possible strings between 2 and n − 1 (inclusive)
If n is divisible by one of them, n is not a prime number

An example of an NTM that decides the language
NOTPRIME:
N =“On input hni where n is a natural numbers:
1

2

Select a number c where c is nondeterministically selected
between 2 and n − 1 (inclusive)
If n mod c == 0, accept.”
