History of Computing
???
– Math invented
~2400 BC – Abacus probably invented in Babylon
???
– More math invented
1600s – John Napier discovers logarithms and
fast log computation
1786 – Johann Müller theorizes a "Difference
Engine"
1822 – Charles Babbage ("father of the
computer") secures funding to build
a Difference Engine (never built)

History of Computing

1837 – Charles Babbage designs "Analytical
Engine"

1841 Prototype on display at The Science Museum in London
(Source: https://s3.yimg.com/te/8543/8649286817_a3042f2c29_z.jpg)

Analytical Engine
• Babbage's Engine is considered the first
general-purpose computer
• Could handle basic math operations, logic,
loops, conditional branching, and had
some primitive memory
• Powered by a hand-crank
• The full-scale version was never built, due
to inadequate funding

Analytical Engine
• Accepted two kinds
of punch cards:
– Top: "Variable Cards"
(Data)
– Bottom: "Operational
Cards" (Instructions)

• Punch cards were
not new (used to
direct mechanical
looms at the time)

Ada Lovelace
• In 1842, she
recognized the usage
of multiple, nondirect, complex
operations and
memory could
generate Bernoulli
numbers using
Babbage's Analytical
Engine.
• This is the first
computer program.

Side note: Yes there is a fan-fiction ship musical for Babbage
and Lovelace.

History of Computing

operating
system Unix and the
programming
language C)
founded

of
electronics in Boolean algebra
computation

"Moore's
Law"
1968 – Moore founds Intel (the company behind CPUs
and other chips)
1969 – ARPANET (predecessor to the Internet)
developed
– UNIX developed
1970 – Integrated Circuit Dynamic-RAM developed

microprocessor (4004)
– Famous "P vs. NP" problem stated by Kurt
Gödel
– Floppy disks invented
1972 – C invented
1975 – First personal computer sold (Altair 8800)

1976 – Apple founded
– LISP invented

History of Computing
1978 – SQL invented
1982 – Sun Microsystems (company behind
Java) founded
1984 – C++ invented
1985 – CD-ROM developed
1989 – World Wide Web invented

1993 – Concept of an Internet search engine
developed

History of Computing
1994 – First smartphone developed
1995 – USB invented
– DVD-ROM invented
– Java invented

Java Today
• Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems in
2010.
• One of the most widely used languages,
primarily found in business enterprises,
web applications, or mobile phones (i.e.
Android).
• Current version: Java SE 8u102

Why Learn Java?
• Widely used
• Constantly updating and receiving
support
• Easily understood due to standardized
and consistent syntax
• Forces code readability
• Virtual Machine isolates running code

Software Layers
• Applications: Software
that interfaces with
the user
• System Software:
Operating System
(e.g. Windows, Mac
OSX, Linux)
• Device Drivers:
Software to talk to
non-computer devices
(e.g. printers,
webcams, etc.)
