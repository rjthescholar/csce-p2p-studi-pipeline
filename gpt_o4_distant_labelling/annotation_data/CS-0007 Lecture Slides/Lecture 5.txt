and the Application Programming Interface (API)

STRINGS

Strings
• A length of characters encased in
quotation marks.
String name = "Nathan";

Application Programming
Interface
• The Java “dictionary”
• http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/
api/

What Can I Do with It?
• Look up relevant classes (e.g. String) for
their relevant functions/methods.

An Example
• What is the 4th character of "Nathan"
and how do I get it?
• Check the API

Code Example
public class Name
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
String name = "Nathan";
System.out.println(name.charAt(4));
}//end method main
}//end class Name

There’s one slight issue

Counting in Java
The first character in the series is at the
0th index

Code Example
public class Name
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
String name = "Nathan";
System.out.println(name.charAt(3));
}//end method main
}//end class Name

The 4th character is at the 3rd index

Code Example

Another Example
• How do I get "urge" from "hamburger"?
• (It’s a substring)
• Check the API

Re-Counting in Java
The first character in the substring is at
the 4th index

Re-Counting in Java
The last character in the substring is at
the 7th index

Another Example
public class DriveThru
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
String fastFood = "hamburger";
System.out.println(fastFood.substring(4,7));
}//end method main
}//end class DriveThru

There’s one slight issue
“The substring begins at the specified beginIndex and
extends to the character at index endIndex – 1”
Where can I find this information?

Re-Counting in Java
The last character in the substring is at
the 7th index  endIndex – 1 = 7

Another Example
public class DriveThru
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
String fastFood = "hamburger";
System.out.println(fastFood.substring(4,8));
}//end method main
}//end class DriveThru

.

Another Example

You must learn to embrace the
API

Math Class

Remember from before
• The caret (^) does NOT indicate
exponentiation
• In other words, in Java, 2^3 does not
equal 8
• There is another way to do
exponentiation; maybe it is in the Math
class?

Math Example
public class MorePower
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
double base = 2.0;
double exponent = 3.0;
System.out.println(Math.pow(base,exponent));
}//end method main
}//end class MorePower

.

Math Example

When to Use the Variable/Class
Name
• Does the “Modifier and Type” column of
the method say “static”?
– Yes: Use Class name (typically uppercase
first letter)
– No: Use variable name (typically lowercase
first letter)
