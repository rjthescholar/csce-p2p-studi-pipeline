A technical support conundrum
Alice and Bob are technical support agents. If an agent
is having a bad day, he or she will always lie to you. If
an agent is having a good day, he or she will always
tell you the truth. Alice tells you that Bob is having a
bad day. Bob tells you that he and Alice are both
having the same type of day. Can you trust the advice
you receive from Alice during your call?

Solving logic puzzles is easy!

Step 1: Identify rules
and constraints

Step 2: Assign propositions
to key concepts

Step 3: Make assumptions
and reason logically!

Technical support revisited
Alice and Bob are technical support agents. If an agent is having a
bad day, he or she will always lie to you. If an agent is having a
good day, he or she will always tell you the truth. Alice tells you
that Bob is having a bad day. Bob tells you that he and Alice are
both having the same type of day. Can you trust the advice you
receive from Alice during your call?

Step 1: Identify the rules of the puzzle
l Good day = tell the truth
l Bad day = lie!

Step 2: Assign propositions to the key concepts in the puzzle
l a º “Alice is having a good day”
l b º “Bob is having a good day”

Step 3: Make assumptions and reason logically

Another example
Consider a group of friends: Frank, Anna, and Chris. If
Frank is not the oldest, then Anna is. If Anna is not the
youngest, then Chris is the oldest. Determine the
relative ages of Frank, Anna, and Chris.
Propositions:
l
l
l
l

f = “Frank is the oldest”
a = “Anna is the oldest”
a’ = “Anna is the youngest”
c = “Chris is the oldest”

Rules:
1. ¬f ® a
2. ¬a’ ® c

Step 3: Make assumptions and reason logically

Sometimes no solution is a solution!
Alice and Bob are technical support agents. Alice says
“I am having a good day.” Bob says “I am having a good
day.” Can you trust either Alice or Bob?

Step 1: Identify rules
l Good day = tell the truth
l Bad day = lie

Step 2: Assign propositions
l a = Alice is having a good day
l b = Bob is having a good day

Step 3: Make assumptions and reason logically

In-class exercises
Problem 1: Alice and Bob are technical support agents
working to fix your computer. Alice tells you that Bob
is having a bad day today and that you should expect a
long wait before your computer is fixed. Bob tells you
not to worry, Alice is just having a bad day—your
computer will be ready in no time.

Question: Can you draw any conclusions about when
your computer will be fixed? If so, what
can you learn?

Propositional equivalences: preliminaries
Definition: A tautology is a compound proposition that is
always true, regardless of the truth values of
the propositions occurring within it.
Definition: A contradiction is a compound proposition
that is always false, regardless of the truth
values of the propositions occurring within it.
Definition: A contingency is a compound proposition
whose truth value is dependent on the
propositions occurring within it.

Examples
Are the following compound propositions tautologies,
contradictions, or contingencies?

p Ú ¬p

What are logical equivalences and why are they
useful?
Definition: Compound propositions p and q are
logically equivalent if p « q is a tautology.
The notation p º q means that p and q are
logically equivalent.
Logical equivalences are extremely useful!
l Aid in the construction of proofs
l Allow us to simplify compound propositions

Example: p ® q º ¬p Ú q

How do we
prove this type
of statement?

It is easy to prove propositional equivalences
We can prove simple logical equivalences using our
good friend the truth table!
Prove: p ® q º ¬p Ú q

DeMorgan’s laws allow us to distribute negation
over compound propositions
If “p or q” isn’t true, then
neither p nor q is true

Two laws:
l ¬(p Ú q) º ¬p Ù ¬q
l ¬(p Ù q) º ¬p Ú ¬q

If “p and q” isn’t true, then at
least one of p or q is false

Prove: ¬(p Ú q) º ¬p Ù ¬q

¬(p Ú q)

Using DeMorgan’s laws
Use DeMorgan’s laws to negate the following expressions:
n “Bob is wearing blue pants and a sweatshirt”
lb Ù s
l ¬(b Ù s) º ¬b Ú ¬s
l Bob is not wearing blue pants or is not wearing a
sweatshirt
n “I will drive or I will walk”
ld Ú w
l ¬(d Ú w) º ¬d Ù ¬w
l I will not drive and I will not walk

In-class exercises
Problem 2: Prove that ¬(p Ù q) and ¬p Ú ¬q are
logically equivalent, i.e., ¬(p Ù q) º ¬p Ú ¬q. This is
the second DeMorgan’s law.
Problem 3: Use DeMorgan’s laws to negate the
following propositions:
l Today I will go running or ride my bike
l Tom likes both pizza and beer

Sometimes using truth tables to prove logical
equivalencies can become cumbersome
Recall that for an equivalence with n propositions, we
need to build a truth table with 2n rows
l Fine for tables with n = 2, 3, or 4
l Consider n = 30—we would need 1,073,741,824 rows in the
truth table!

Another option: Direct manipulation
of compound propositions using
known logical equivalencies
