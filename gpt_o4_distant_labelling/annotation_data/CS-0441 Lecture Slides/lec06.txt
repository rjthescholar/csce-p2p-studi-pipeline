Lecture #6: Rules of Inference

Based on materials developed by Dr. Adam Lee

Today’s topics
n Rules of inference
l Logical equivalences allowed us to rewrite and simplify
single logical statements.
l How do we deduce new information by combining
information from (perhaps multiple) known truths?

What have we learned? Where are we going?
Predicate logic
(refined representation)

Propositional logic
(representation)

Quantifiers
(generalization)

Inference and proof
(deriving new knowledge!)

Writing valid proofs is a subtle art
This is called
“research”
Step 1: Discover and
formalize the property
that you wish to prove

Step 2: Formalize the ground truths
(axioms) that you will use to prove
this property

Subtle, but not terribly
difficult
Step 3: Show that the property in
question follows from the truth of
your axioms

This is the hard part…

What is science without jargon?
A conjecture is a statement that is thought to be true.
A proof is a valid argument that establishes the truth
of a given statement (i.e., a conjecture)
The truth of the conclusion follows
from the truth of the preceding
statements

A sequence of statements ending
with a conclusion

After a proof has been found for a given conjecture, it
becomes a theorem

A tale of two proof techniques
In a formal proof, each step of
the proof clearly follows from
the postulates and axioms
assumed in the conjecture.
Statements that are assumed to be true

In an informal proof, one step in
the proof may consist of
multiple derivations, portions of
the proof may be skipped or
assumed correct, and axioms
may not be explicitly stated.

How can we formalize an argument?
Consider the following argument:
“If you have an account, you can access the network”
“You have an account”
Therefore,
“You can access the network”
Premises
Conclusion

This argument seems valid, but how can we
demonstrate this formally??

Let’s analyze the form of our argument
p

q

“If you have an account, then you can access the network”
“You have an account”
Therefore,
“You can access the network”
This is called a “rule of
inference”

p→q
p
∴q

Rules of inference are logically valid ways to draw
conclusions when constructing a formal proof
The previous rule is called modus ponens
l Rule of inference: p → q
p
∴q
l Informally: Given an implication p → q, if we know that p
is true, then q is also true

But why can we trust modus ponens?
l Tautology: ((p → q) ∧ p) → q
l Truth table: p
q
p→q
T

Any time that p→q and p
are both true, q is also
true!

There are lots of other rules of inference that
we can use!
Addition
l Tautology: p → (p ∨ q)
p
l Rule of inference:
∴p∨q
l Example: “It is raining now, therefore it is raining now or
it is snowing now.”

Simplification
l Tautology: p ∧ q → p
p∧q
l Rule of inference:
∴p
l Example: “It is cold outside and it is snowing. Therefore, it
is cold outside.”

There are lots of other rules of inference that
we can use!
Modus tollens
l Tautology: [¬q ∧ (p → q)] → ¬p
l Rule of inference: p → q
¬q
∴ ¬p
l Example: “If I am hungry, then I will eat. I am not eating.
Therefore, I am not hungry.”

Hypothetical syllogism
l Tautology: [(p → q) ∧ (q → r)] → (p → r)
l Rule of inference: (p → q)
(q → r)
∴ (p → r)
l Example: “If I eat a big meal, then I feel full. If I feel full,
then I am happy. Therefore, if I eat a big meal, then I am
happy.”

There are lots of other rules of inference that
we can use!
Disjunctive syllogism
l Tautology: [¬p ∧ (p ∨ q)] → q
l Rule of inference: p ∨ q
¬p
∴q
l Example: “Either the heat is broken, or I have a fever.
The heat is not broken, therefore I have a fever.”

Conjunction
l Tautology: [(p) ∧ (q)] → (p ∧ q)
l Rule of inference: p
q
∴ (p ∧ q)
l Example: “Jack is tall. Jack is skinny. Therefore, Jack is
tall and skinny.”

There are lots of other rules of inference that
we can use!
Resolution
l Tautology: [(p ∨ q) ∧ (¬p ∨ r)] → (q ∨ r)
l Rule of inference: p ∨ q
¬p ∨ r
∴q∨r
l Example: “If it is not raining, I will ride my bike. If it is
raining, I will lift weights. Therefore, I will ride my bike or
lift weights”

Special cases:
1. If r = q, we get

p∨q
¬p ∨ q
∴q

2. If r = F, we get

p∨q
¬p
∴q

We can use rules of inference to build valid arguments

If it is raining, I will stay inside. If I am inside, Lisa
will stay home. If Lisa stays home and it is a Saturday,
then we will play video games. Today is Saturday. It
is raining.

Let:
l r ≡ It is raining
l i ≡ I am inside
l l ≡ Lisa will stay home
l p ≡ we will play video games
l s ≡ it is Saturday

Hypotheses:
l r→i
l i→l
l l∧s→p
l s
l r

We also have rules of inference for statements
with quantifiers
Universal Instantiation
l Intuition: If we know that P(x) is true for all x, then P(c) is
true for a particular c
l Rule of inference: ∀x P(x)
∴ P(c)

Universal Generalization
l Intuition: If we can show that P(c) is true for an arbitrary c,
then we can conclude that P(x) is true for any specific x
l Rule of inference: P(c)
∴ ∀xP(x)
Note that “arbitrary” does not mean “randomly chosen.” It
means that we cannot make any assumptions about c other than
the fact that it comes from the appropriate domain.

We also have rules of inference for statements
with quantifiers
Existential Instantiation
l Intuition: If we know that ∃x P(x) is true, then we know
that P(c) is true for some c
l Rule of inference: ∃x P(x)
∴ P(c)
Again, we cannot make assumptions about c other than the fact
that it exists and is from the appropriate domain.

Existential Generalization
l Intuition: If we can show that P(c) is true for a particular c,
then we can conclude that ∃x P(x) is true
l Rule of inference: P(c)
∴ ∃xP(x)

HW1 has not read the book.”

science” and “Melissa is a student in this discrete
math class” lead to the conclusion “Melissa has taken
a course in computer science.”
