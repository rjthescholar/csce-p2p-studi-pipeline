Once and for all, what are prime numbers?
Definition: A prime number is a positive integer p that is
divisible by only 1 and itself. If a number is not prime, it is called
a composite number.

Mathematically: p is prime ⇔ ∀ x∈Z+ [(x≠1 ∧ x≠p) → x /| p]
Examples: Are the following numbers prime or composite?
l 23
l 42

Composite, 42 = 2× 3× 7

l 17

l 9

Composite, 9 = 32

Any positive integer can be represented as a
unique product of prime numbers!
Theorem (The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic): Every
positive integer greater than 1 can be written uniquely as a prime
or the product of two or more primes where the prime factors are
written in order of non-decreasing size.

Examples:
l 100 = 2× 2× 5× 5 = 22× 52
l 641 = 641
l 999 = 3× 3× 3× 37 = 33× 37
l 1024 = 2× 2× 2× 2× 2× 2× 2× 2× 2× 2 = 210

Note: Proving the fundamental theorem of arithmetic requires
some mathematical tools that we have not yet learned.

This leads to a related theorem…
Theorem: If n is a composite integer, then n has a
prime divisor less than or equal to √n.

Proof:
l If n is composite, then it has a positive integer factor a with
1 < a < n by definition. This means that n = ab, where b is
an integer greater than 1.
l Assume a > √n and b > √n. Then ab > √n√n = n, which is a
contradiction. So either a ≤ √n or b ≤ √n.
l Thus, n has a divisor less than or equal to √n.
l By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, this divisor is
either prime, or is a product of primes. In either case, n
has a prime divisor less than or equal to √n. ❏

Applying contraposition leads to a naive
primality test
Corollary: If n is a positive integer that does not have
a prime divisor less than or equal to √n, then n is
prime.

Example: Is 101 prime?
l The primes less than or equal to √101 are 2, 3, 5, and 7
l Since 101 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, it must be prime

Example: Is 1147 prime?
l The primes less than or equal to √1147 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11,
13, 17, 23, 29, and 31
l 1147 = 31× 37, so 1147 must be composite

This approach can be generalized
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a brute-force algorithm for finding all
prime numbers less than some value n
Step 1: List the numbers less than n

Step 2: If the next available number is less than √n, cross out all
of its multiples
Step 3: Repeat until the next available number is > √n
Step 4: All remaining numbers are prime

How many primes are there?
Theorem: There are infinitely many prime numbers.
Proof: By contradiction
l Assume that there are only a finite number of primes p1, …, pn
l Let Q = p1 × p2 × … × pn + 1
l By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, Q can be written as
the product of two or more primes.
l Note that no pj divides Q, for if pj | Q, then pj also divides Q – p1
× p2 × … × pn = 1.
l Therefore, there must be some prime number not in our list. This
prime number is either Q (if Q is prime) or a prime factor of Q (if
Q is composite).
l This is a contradiction since we assumed that all primes were
listed. Therefore, there are infinitely many primes. ❏

This is a non-constructive existence proof!

In-class exercises
Problem 1: What is the prime factorization of 984?
Problem 2: Is 157 prime? Is 97 prime?
Problem 3: Is the set of all prime numbers countable
or uncountable? If it is countable, show a 1-to-1
correspondence between the prime numbers and
the natural numbers.

Greatest common divisors
Definition: Let a and b be integers, not both zero.
The largest integer d such that d | a and d | b is called
the greatest common divisor of a and b, denoted by
gcd(a, b).
Note: We can (naively) find GCDs by comparing the
common divisors of two numbers.

Example: What is the GCD of 24 and 36?
l Factors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
l Factors of 36: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36
l ∴ gcd(24, 36) = 12

Sometimes, the GCD of two numbers is 1
Example: What is gcd(17, 22)?
l Factors of 17: 1, 17
l Factors of 22: 1, 2, 11, 22
l ∴ gcd(17, 22) = 1

Definition: If gcd(a, b) = 1, we say that a and b are
relatively prime, or coprime. We say that a1, a2, …,
an are pairwise relatively prime if gcd(ai, aj) = 1
∀i,j.

Example: Are 10, 17, and 21 pairwise coprime?
l Factors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10
l Factors of 17: 1, 17
l Factors of 21: 1, 3, 7, 21

Yes!

We can leverage the fundamental theorem of
arithmetic to develop a better algorithm
Let:
Then:

Greatest multiple of p1 in both
a and b

and

Greatest multiple of p2 in both
a and b

Example: Compute gcd(120, 500)
l 120 = 23× 3× 5
l 500 = 22× 53
l So gcd(120, 500) = 22× 30× 5 = 20

Better still is Euclid’s algorithm
Observation: If a = bq + r, then gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r)

Proved in section 4.3 of the book

So, let r0 = a and r1 = b. Then:
l r0 = r1q1 + r2
l r1 = r2q2 + r3
l…
l rn-2 = rn-1qn-1 + rn
l rn-1 = rnqn

gcd(a, b) = rn

0 ≤ r2 < r1
0 ≤ r3 < r2
0 ≤ rn < rn-1

Examples of Euclid’s algorithm
Example: Compute gcd(414, 662)
l 662 = 414 × 1 + 248
l 414 = 248 × 1 + 166
l 248 = 166 × 1 + 82
l 166 = 82 × 2 + 2
l 82 = 2 × 41

gcd(414, 662) = 2

Example: Compute gcd(9888, 6060)
l 9888 = 6060 × 1 + 3828
l 6060 = 3828 × 1 + 2232
l 3828 = 2232 × 1 + 1596
l 2232 = 1596 × 1 + 636
l 1596 = 636 × 2 + 324
l 636 = 324 × 1 + 312
l 324 = 312 × 1 + 12
l 312 = 12 × 26

gcd(9888, 6060) = 12

Least common multiples
Definition: The least common multiple of the integers
a and b is the smallest positive integer that is divisible
by both a and b. The least common multiple of a and
b is denoted lcm(a, b).

Example: What is lcm(3,12)?
l Multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, …
l Multiples of 12: 12, 24, 36, …
l So lcm(3,12) = 12

Note: lcm(a, b) is guaranteed to exist, since a
common multiple exists (i.e., ab).

We can leverage the fundamental theorem of
arithmetic to develop a better algorithm
Let:
Then:

Greatest multiple of p1 in either
a or b

and

Greatest multiple of p2 in
either a or b

Example: Compute lcm(120, 500)
l 120 = 23× 3× 5
l 500 = 22× 53
l So lcm(120, 500) = 23× 3× 53 = 3000 << 120× 500 =
60,000

LCMs are closely tied to GCDs
Note: ab = lcm(a, b)× gcd(a, b)

Example: a = 120 = 23 × 3 × 5, b = 500 = 22 × 53
l 120 = 23× 3× 5
l 500 = 22× 53
l lcm(120, 500) = 23× 3× 53 = 3000
l gcd(120, 500) = 22× 30× 5 = 20
l lcm(120, 500)× gcd(120, 500)
= 23× 3× 53× 22× 30× 5
= 25× 3× 54
= 60,000 = 120× 500
