What is combinatorics?
Combinatorics is the study of arrangements of discrete
objects.
We can think of this as a fancy
word for “counting”

Many applications throughout computer science:
l Algorithm complexity analysis
l Resource allocation & scheduling
l Security analysis
l…

Today, we will learn the basics of counting. More
advanced topics will be covered in later lectures.

A motivating example…
To access most computer systems, you need to login
with a user name and a password.

Suppose that for a certain system
l Passwords must contain either 6, 7, or 8 characters
l Each character must be an uppercase letter or a digit
l Every password must contain at least one digit

How many valid passwords are there?

Solving these types of problems requires that we learn
how to count complex objects
Fortunately, we can solve many types of combinatorial
problems using two simple rules:

The product rule

The sum rule

Product rule applies when a counting problem
can be broken into multiple tasks
The Product Rule: Suppose a procedure can be broken
into a sequence t1, t2, …, tk of tasks. Further, let there
be n1, n2, …, nk ways to complete each task. Then there
are n1× n2× …× nk ways to complete the procedure.
To apply the product rule, do the following:
1. Identify each task t1, …, tk
2. For each task ti, determine the ni, the number of possible
ways to complete ti
3. Compute n1× n2× …× nk

Let’s look at a few examples…

An example: Assigning offices
Example: It is Sherif and Bill’s first day of work at Pitt.
If there are 10 unused offices in their department, how
many ways can Sherif and Bill be assigned an office?

Step 1: Determine tasks
1. Give Sherif an office
2. Give Bill an office

Step 2: Count possible completions
1. Can give any one of 10 offices to Sherif
2. Can give any one of the remaining 9 offices to Bill

Step 3: Compute the product
l

Sherif and Bill can be assigned offices in 10× 9 = 90 ways!

Auditorium Seating
Example: The chairs in an auditorium are to be labeled
using an upper case letter and a positive number not
exceeding 100 (e.g., B23). What is the maximum
number of seats that can be placed in the auditorium?

Solution:
l Task 1: Count the letters that can be used
(26)
l Task 2: Count the numbers that can be used
(100)
l So, the auditorium can hold 26× 100 = 2600 chairs.

Counting Bit Strings
Example: How many bit strings of length 5 are there?
Solution:
l Task 1: Choose first bit
l Task 2: Choose second bit
l Task 3: Choose third bit
l Task 4: Choose fourth bit
l Task 5: Choose fifth bit

(2)
(2)
(2)
(2)
(2)

l So, there are 2× 2× 2× 2× 2 = 25 = 32 bit strings of length 5

Counting 1-to-1 Functions
Example: How many 1-to-1 functions are there
mapping a set A containing m elements to another set
B containing n elements (assuming that m ≤ n)?

Solution:
l Task 1: Map first element of A to B
l Task 2: Map second element of A to B
l Task 3: Map third element of A to B
l …
l Task m: Map last element of A to B

(n)
(n-1)
(n-2)
(n-m+1)

l So, there are a total of n ×(n-1) ×… ×(n-m+1) 1-to-1
functions from A to B

License Plates
Example: Suppose that in some state, license plates
consist of three letters followed by three decimal
digits. How many valid license plates are there?

A B C 1 2 3
26 choices for each

10 choices for each

Solution: There are 263×103 = 17,576,000 possible
valid license plates

The sum rule applies when a single task can be
completed using several different approaches
The Sum Rule: Suppose that a single task can be
completed in either one of n1 ways, one of n2 ways, …,
or one of nk ways. Then the task can be completed in n1
+ n2 + … + nk different ways.
Note: We can break the set of all possible solutions to
the problem into disjoint subsets. E.g., if we have k
“classes” of solutions, then S = S1 ∪ S2 ∪ … ∪ Sk
l |S| = |S1 ∪ S2 ∪ … ∪ Sk|
l
= |S1| + |S2| + … + |Sk|
l
= n1 + n2 + … + nk

Since S1, …, SK are disjoint

University Committees
Example: Suppose that either a CS professor or a CS
graduate student can be nominated to serve on the CS
Day Committee. If there are 21 CS professors and 101
CS graduate students, how many ways can this seat on
the committee be chosen?

Solution:
l Let
➣ P be the set of professors
➣ G be the set of graduate students
➣ S be the solution set, with S = P ∪ G

l Then there are |S| = |P ∪ G| = |P| + |G| = 21 + 101 = 122
ways to fill the empty seat on the committee.

Travel Choices
Example: Jane wants to travel from Pittsburgh to New
York City. If she flies, she can leave at any one of 12
departure times. If she takes the bus, she can leave at
any one of 6 departure times. If she takes the train, she
can leave at any one of 4 departure times. How many
different departure times can Jane choose from?

Solution:
l S = F ∪ B ∪ T, so
l |S| = |F ∪ B ∪ T|
l
l
l

= |F| + |B| + |T|
= 12 + 6 + 4
= 22 departure times

The product and sum rules are kind of boring…
Most interesting counting problems cannot
be solved using the product rule or the
sum rule alone…

… but many interesting problems can be
solved by combining these two approaches!

Let’s revisit our password example…

Passwords revisited…
To access most computer systems, you need to login
with a user name and a password.
Use the product rule to count
passwords of each possible
length!

Choices: Sum rule!

Suppose that for a certain system
l Passwords must contain either 6, 7, or 8 characters
l Each character must be an uppercase letter or a digit
l Every password must contain at least one digit

How many valid passwords are there?

First, we’ll apply the sum rule
Let:
l P6 = Set of passwords of length 6
l P7 = Set of passwords of length 7
l P8 = Set of passwords of length 8
l S = P6 ∪ P7 ∪ P8

Note: |S| = |P6| + |P7| + |P8|
Since each element of P6, P7, and P8 is made up of
independent choices of letters and numbers, we can
apply the product rule to determine |P6|, |P7|, and
|P8|

Recall: a password must contain at least one number!

Observation: To figure out the number of 6-character
passwords containing at least one number, it is easier
for us to count all 6-character passwords and then
subtract away those passwords not containing a
number.
Note: there are
l (26 + 10)6 = 366 6-character passwords
l 266 6-character passwords not containing a digit

So, |P6| = 366 – 266 = 1,867,866,560

Wrapping it all up…
We can compute
l |P6| = 366 – 266 = 1,867,866,560
l |P7| = 367 – 267 = 70,332,353,920
l |P8| = 368 – 268 = 2,612,282,842,880

By leveraging our earlier observation that |S| = |P6| + |P7|
+ |P8|, we can conclude that there are
2,684,483,063,360 valid passwords for our target
system.

IP Addresses
An IP address (in IPv4) is a 32-bit string that is used to
identify a computer that is connected to the Internet.

There are three categories of IP addresses that can be
assigned to computers:
1. Class A addresses consist of the prefix “0” followed by a 7bit network ID and a 24-bit host ID
2. Class B addresses consist of the prefix “10” followed by a
14-bit network ID and a 16-bit host ID
3. Class C addresses consist of the prefix “110” followed by a
21-bit network ID and an 8-bit host ID

So how many valid IP addresses are there?
Note: IP addresses are subject to restrictions:
l 1111111 cannot be used as the network ID of a Class A IP
l Host IDs consisting of only 1s or only 0s cannot be used

To count IP addresses, we will use the sum rule and
the product rule. So S = SA ∪ SB ∪ SC, so |S| = |SA|
+ |SB| + |SC|
Compute SA:
l 27 – 1 network IDs since 1111111 can’t be used
l 224 – 2 host IDs for each network ID
l Total of 2,130,706,178 Class A IP addresses

So how many valid IP addresses are there? (cont.)
Compute SB:
l 214 network IDs
l 216 – 2 host IDs for each network ID
l Total of 1,073,709,056 Class B IP addresses

Compute SC:
l 221 network IDs
l 28 – 2 host IDs for each network ID
l Total of 532,676,608 Class C IP addresses

Since |S| = |SA| + |SB| + |SC|, there are
3,737,091,842 IP addresses that can be assigned to
computers connected to the Internet!
