Lecture #20: Discrete Probability

Based on materials developed by Dr. Adam Lee

The study of probability is concerned with the
likelihood of events occurring
Like combinatorics, the origins of probability theory
can be traced back to the study of gambling games
Still a popular branch of mathematics with many
applications:
Risk Assessment
Simulation
Genetics

Algorithm Design

Gambling

Many situations can be analyzed using a
simplified model of probability
Assumptions:
1. Finite number of possible outcomes
2. Each outcome is equally likely

Card games
Dice

Flipping coins

Roulette

Lotteries

Terminology
Definitions:
l An experiment is a procedure that yields one of a given set of
possible outcomes
l The sample space of an experiment is the set of possible outcomes
l An event is a subset of the sample space
l Given a finite sample space S of equally-likely outcomes, the
probability of an event E is p(E) = |E|/|S|.

Example:
l Experiment: Roll a single 6-sided die one time
l Sample space: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
l One possible event: Roll an even number ‚áí {2, 4, 6}
l The probability of rolling an even number is
|{2, 4, 6}| / |{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}| = 3/6 = 1/2

Solving these simplified finite probability
problems is ‚Äúeasy‚Äù
I told you that combinatorics and
probability were related!

Step 1: Identify and
count the sample space

/

Step 3: Divide!

Step 2: Count the size of
the desired event space

When two dice are rolled, what is the probability that
the sum of the two numbers is seven?
Step 1: Identify and count sample space
l Sample space, S, is all possible pairs of numbers 1-6
l Product rule tells us that |S| = 62 = 36

Step 2: Count event space
l (1, 6)
l (2, 5)
l (3, 4)
l (4, 3)
l (5, 2)
l (6, 1)

|E| = 6

Step 3: Divide
l Probability of rolling two dice that sum to 7 is p(E)
l p(E) = |E|/|S| = 6/36 = 1/6

Balls and Bins
Example: A bin contains 4 green balls and 5 red balls.
What is the probability that a ball chosen from the bin
is green?

Solution:
l 9 possible outcomes (balls)
l 4 green balls, so |E| = 4
l So p(E) = 4/9 that a green
ball is chosen

Hit the lotto
Example: Suppose a lottery gives a large prize to a person who
picks 4 digits between 0-9 in the correct order, and a smaller
prize if only three digits are matched. What is the probability of
winning the large prize? The small prize?

Solution:
Grand prize
l S = possible lottery outcomes
l |S| = 104 = 10,000
l E = all 4 digits correct
l |E| = 1
l So p(E) = 1/10,000 = 0.0001

Smaller prize
l S = possible lottery outcomes
l |S| = 104 = 10,000
l E = one digit incorrect
l We can count |E| using the sum rule:
l
l
l
l

9 ways to get 1st digit wrong OR
9 ways to get 2nd digit wrong OR
9 ways to get 3rd digit wrong OR
9 ways to get 4th digit wrong

l So |E| = 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36
l p(E) = 36/10,000 = 0.0036

Mega Lotteries
Example: Consider a lottery that awards a prize if a person can
correctly choose a set of 6 numbers from the set of the first 40
positive numbers. What is the probability of winning this lottery?

Solution:
l S = All sets of six numbers between 1 and 40
l Note that order does not matter in this lottery
l Thus, |S| = C(40, 6) = 40!/(6!34!) = 3,838,380
l Only one way to do this correctly, so |E| = 1
l So p(E) = 1/3,838,380 ‚âà 0.00000026

Lesson: You stand a better chance at being struck by
lightning than winning this lottery!

Four of a Kind
Example: What is the probability of getting ‚Äúfour of a
kind‚Äù in a 5-card poker hand?

Solution:
l S = set of all possible poker hands
l Recall |S| = C(52,5) = 2,598,960
l E = all poker hands with 4 cards of the same type
l To draw a four of a kind hand:
‚û£ C(13, 1) ways to choose the type of card (2, 3, ‚Ä¶, King, Ace)
‚û£ C(4,4) = 1 way to choose all 4 cards of that type
‚û£ C(48, 1) ways to choose the 5th card in the hand
‚û£ So, |E| = C(13,1)C(4,4)C(48,1) = 13 √ó48 = 624
l p(E) = 624/2,598,960 ‚âà 0.00024

A Full House
Example: What is the probability of drawing a full house when
drawing a 5-card poker hand? (Reminder: A full house is three
cards of one kind, and two cards of another kind.)

Solution:
l |S| = C(52,5) = 2,598,960
l E = all hands containing a full house
l To draw a full house:
‚û£ Choose two types of cards (order matters)
‚û£ Choose three cards of the first type
‚û£ Choose two cards of the second type

l So |E| = 13 √ó12 √ó4 √ó6 = 3,744
l p(E) = 3,744/2,598,960 ‚âà 0.0014

P(13, 2) = 13 √ó 12 ways
C(4, 3) = 4 ways
C(4, 2) = 6 ways

Sampling with or without replacement makes a
difference!
Example: Consider a bin containing balls labeled with the
numbers 1, 2, ‚Ä¶, 50. How likely is the sequence 23, 4, 3, 12, 48
to be drawn in order if a selected ball is not returned to the bin?
What if selected balls are immediately returned to the bin?

Solution:
l Note: Since order is important, we need to consider 5-permutations
l If balls are not returned to the bin, we have P(50, 5) = 50 √ó49 √ó48 √ó47 √ó
46 = 254,251,200 ways to select 5 balls
l If balls are returned, we have 505 = 312,500,000 ways to select 5 balls
l Since there is only one way to select the sequence 23, 4, 3, 12, 48 in
order, we have that
‚û£ p(E) = 1/254,251,200 if balls are not replaced
‚û£ p(E) = 1/312,500,000 if balls are replaced

Yes, calculating probabilities can be easy

Anyone can divide two numbers!
But, Be careful when you:
l Define the sets S and E
l Count the cardinality of S and E

In-class exercises
Problem 1: Consider a box with 3 green balls and 1 pink ball.
What is the probability of drawing a pink ball? What is the
probability of drawing two green balls in two successive picks
(without replacement)?
Problem 2: In poker, a straight flush is a hand in which all 5
cards are from the same suit and occur in order. For example, a
hand containing the 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of hearts would be a straight
flush, while the hand containing the 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 of hearts
would not be. Note that a royal flush (10 through A) is not
considered a straight flush (but A through 5 is). What is the
probability of drawing a straight flush in poker?
Problem 3: A flush is a hand in which all five cards are of the
same suit, but do not form an ordered sequence. What is the
probability of drawing a flush in poker?

What about events that are derived from other
events?
Recall: An event E is a subset of the sample space S

S

Definition: p(E) = 1 ‚Äì p(E)
Proof:
l Note that E = S ‚Äì E, since S is universe of all possible outcomes
l So, |E| = |S| - |E|
l Thus, p(E) = |E|/|S|
by definition
l
= (|S| - |E|)/|S|
by substitution
E
l
= 1 - |E|/|S|
simplification
l
= 1 ‚Äì p(E) ‚ùè
by definition

Why is this useful?

E

Sometimes, counting |E| is hard!
Example: A 10-bit sequence is randomly generated. What is the
probability that at least 1 bit is 0?

Solution:
l S = all 10-bit strings
l |S| = 210
l E = all 10-bit strings with at least 1 zero
l E = all 10-bit strings with no zeros = {1111111111}
l p(E) = 1 ‚Äì p(E)
l
= 1 ‚Äì 1/210
l
= 1 ‚Äì 1/1024
l
= 1023/1024
So the probability of a randomly generated 10-bit string
containing at least one 0 is 1023/1024.

We can also calculate the probability of the
union of two events
Definition: If E1 and E2 are two events in the sample space S,
then p(E1 ‚à™ E2) = p(E1) + p(E2) ‚Äì p(E1 ‚à© E2).

S
E1

E2

Proof:
l Recall: |E1 ‚à™ E2| = |E1| + |E2| - |E1 ‚à© E2|
l p(E1 ‚à™ E2) = |E1 ‚à™ E2|/ |S|
l
= (|E1| + |E2| - |E1 ‚à© E2|) / |S|
l
= |E1|/|S| + |E2|/|S| - |E1 ‚à© E2|/|S|
l
= p(E1) + p(E2) - p(E1 ‚à© E2)

Why does this look
familiar?

Divisibility‚Ä¶
Example: What is the probability that a positive integer not
exceeding 100 is divisible by either 2 or 5?

Solution:
l
l
l

Let E1 be the event that an integer is divisible by 2
Let E2 be the event that an integer is divisible by 5
E1 ‚à™ E2 is the event that an integer is divisible by 2 or 5
E1 ‚à© E2 is the event that an integer is divisible by 2 and 5
|E1| = 50
|E2| = 20
|E1 ‚à© E2| = 10
p(E1 ‚à™ E2) = p(E1) + p(E2) - p(E1 ‚à© E2)
= 50/100 + 20/100 ‚Äì 10/100
= 1/2 + 1/5 - 1/10
= 3/5

Not all events are equally likely to occur‚Ä¶

Sporting events

Games of strategy

Nature

Investments

We can model these types of real-life situations
by relaxing our model of probability
As before, let S be our sample space. Unlike before,
we will allow S to be either finite or countable.
We will require that the following conditions hold:
1. 0 ‚â§ p(s) ‚â§ 1 for each s ‚àà S
2.

‚àë!‚àà# ùëù ùë† = 1

No event can have a negative
likelihood of occurrence, or more than
a 100% chance of occurrence

In 100% of experiments,
one of the outcome occurs

The function p : S ‚Üí [0,1] is called a probability
distribution

Simple example: Fair and unfair coins
Example: What probabilities should be assigned to outcomes
heads (H) and tails (T) if a fair coin is flipped? What if the coin
is biased so that heads is twice as likely to occur as tails?
Case 1: Fair coins
nEach outcome is equally likely
nSo p(H) = 1/2, p(T) = 1/2
nCheck:
l 0 ‚â§ 1/2 ‚â§ 1
l 1/2 + 1/2 = 1

‚úî

Case 2: Biased coins
nNote:
1. p(H) = 2p(T)
2. p(H) + p(T) = 1

n2p(T) + p(T) = 1
n3p(T) = 1
np(T) = 1/3, p(H) = 2/3

Are the following probability distributions valid?
Why or why not?
S = {1, 2, 3, 4} where
l
l
l
l

p(1) = 1/3
p(2) = 1/6
p(3) = 1/6
p(4) = 1/3

S = {a, b, c}
l p(a) = 3/4
l p(b) = 1/4
l p(c) = 0

‚úî

S = {1, 2, 3, 4} where

p(1) = 2/3
p(2) = 1/6
p(3) = -1/6
p(4) = 1/3

S = {a, b, c}
l p(a) = 1/2
l p(b) = 1/4
l p(c) = 0

More definitions
Definition: Suppose that S is a set with n elements.
The uniform distribution assigns the probability 1/n to
each element of S.
The distribution of fair coin
flips is a uniform distribution!

Definition: The probability of an event E ‚äÜ S is the
sum of the probabilities of the outcomes in E. That is:
ùëù ùê∏ = %ùëù ùë†
$‚àà&

Loaded dice
Example: Suppose that a die is biased so that 3 appears twice as
often as each other number, but that the other five outcomes are
equally likely. What is the probability that an odd number
appears when we roll this die?

Solution:
l
l
l
l

p(1) + p(2) + p(3) + p(4) + p(5) + p(6) = 1
Note that p(1) = p(2) = p(4) = p(5) = p(6) and p(3) = 2p(1)
So, p(1) + p(1) + 2p(1) + p(1) + p(1) + p(1) = 7p(1) = 1
Thus p(1) = p(2) = p(4) = p(5) = p(6) = 1/7 and p(3) = 2/7

l Now, we want to find p(E), where E = {1, 3, 5}
l p(E) = p(1) + p(3) + p(5)
l
= 1/7 + 2/7 + 1/7
l
= 4/7

In-class exercises
Consider a die in which (i) 1, 3, and 4 are rolled with the same
frequency, (ii) 2 is rolled 3 times as often as 1, (iii) 5 is rolled 2
times as often as 4, (iv) and 6 is rolled 4 times as often as 2.
Problem 4: What is the probability distribution for this die?
Problem 5: What is the probability of rolling a 1 or a 3?
Problem 6: What is the probability of rolling an even number?
An odd number?

Final Thoughts
n Probability allows us to analyze the likelihood of
events occurring
n Today, we learned how to analyze events that are
equally likely, as well as those that have non-equal
probabilities of occurrence
