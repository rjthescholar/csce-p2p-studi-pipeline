Sets

Set is a group of objects represented as a unit.
{a, b, c}
{1, 2, 3, . . . }
{} or ∅ (the empty set)

Characteristic of Sets
Unordered
{a, b, c} = {b, c, a}

No duplicate
{1, 2, 3, 2} = {1, 2, 3}

Can be finite, infinite, or empty (finite)

Use ∈ or 6∈ to indicate membership status
1 ∈ {1, 2, 3}
c 6∈ {a, b}

Mathematics Preliminaries

Functions

Function: f : D → R
D is a set (domain)
R is a set (range)
f associates each element d ∈ D with some element r ∈ R
Denoted by f (d) = r.

Example: f (x) = (x + 1) mod 3
D : {1, 2, 3, 4}
R : {0, 1, 2}
Associations are as follows:
f (1) = 2
f (2) = 0
f (3) = 1
f (4) = 2

Mathematics Preliminaries

Predicates

A predicate is a function where its range is {true, false}
Example: f : N → {true, false}
f (x) = x is an even number
f (3) = false
f (14) = true

Thumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu

Mathematics Preliminaries

Predicates and Sets
A set can be defined using a predicate P
B = {x | P(x)}
B is a set that contains all elements x such that P(x) is true
P(a) = true if and only if a ∈ B
Example:
B = {x | x is an even number}
B = {2, 4, 6, 8, . . . }

Example:
C = {(x, y) | x, y ∈ N and x + 1 = y}
C = {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), . . . }

Mathematics Preliminaries

Predicates and Sets

Given a set B = {x | P(x)}, recall that
P(a) = true if and only if a ∈ B
If y ∈ B, we can conclude that P(y) is true
Similarly, if P(y) is true, we can conclude that y ∈ B
If z 6∈ B, we can conclude that P(z) is false
Similarly, if P(z) is false, we can conclude that z 6∈ B

We will encounter these a lot in our proofs

Mathematics Preliminaries

Set Operations
Make sure to review the following set operations:
Union: ∪
A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}

Intersection: ∩
A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}

Complement:
A = {x | x 6∈ A}

Set Different: − or \
A − B = {x | x ∈ A and x 6∈ B}

Cartesian Product: ×
A × B = {(x, y) | x ∈ A and y ∈ B}
Example:
{1, 2} × {a, b} = {(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b)}

If A is a set |A| denotes the number of elements in the set A

Thumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu

Mathematics Preliminaries

Functions
With the notion of the Cartesian product, we can define
functions that take more than one parameters
Example: f (x, y) = max(x, y)
f : A × A → A where A = {1, 2, 3}
The domain is A × A
The range is A
Associations:

f (1, 1) = 1
f (1, 2) = 2
f (1, 3) = 3
f (2, 1) = 2
f (2, 2) = 2
f (2, 3) = 3
f (3, 1) = 3
f (3, 2) = 3
f (3, 3) = 3

Big Union
Suppose we have sets A0 , A1 , . . . An , we can represent the
following set
A0 ∪ A1 ∪ · · · ∪ An
using the Big Union notation as follows:
n
[

Ai

i=1

Note that the condition is for every i where 0 ≤ i ≤ n
Sometimes the condition can be for every element in a set
Example
[

δ(r, a) = δ(1, a) ∪ δ(3, a)

r∈{1,3}

Mathematics Preliminaries

Sequences

A Sequence is a list of objects in some order where duplicate
is allowed:
(a, b, c) 6= (b, c, a)
(a, b, c, b) 6= (a, b, c)
Finite Sequences are generally called tuples
A sequence of k elements is a k-tuple
A 2-tuple usually called an ordered pair

Note: (a, b) = (x, y) if an only if a = x and b = y.

Mathematics Preliminaries

Alphabets and Strings
An alphabet is a finite set of symbols called Σ (sigma)
ΣA = {a, b, c, . . . , z}
ΣB = {0, 1}

A string over Σ is a finite sequence of symbols from Σ
The length of a string s is the number of symbols it contains,
denoted by |s|
Examples:
Let s1 = (h, e, l, l, o)
s1 is a string over ΣA
|s1 | = 5
For simplicity, s1 = hello

Let s2 = (1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1)
s2 is a string over ΣB
|s2 | is 6
For simplicity, s2 = 101101

Mathematics Preliminaries

Alphabets and Strings

A string can be empty
ε is used to represent the empty string.

Concatenation:
Let s and t be strings over Σ, st is the string obtained by
appending string t to the end of string s.
Example
Suppose s = 101 and t = 10, st = 10110

A string s is a substring of a string t if there exists strings u
and v such that t = usv
Note that u and v can be ε

Thumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu

Mathematics Preliminaries

Languages
A language is a set of strings over Σ
Can be finite, infinite, or empty (∅)

Example:
Let Σ = {a, b}
An example of a language B can be
B = {a, b, aa, ab, ba, bb, aaa, aab}

We generally use shortlex order to list a set of strings
(shorter strings precede longer string)
The lexicographic ordering which is dictionary ordering may
give you a false information
Consider listing the set of all strings over {a, b}:
Sortlex Order: {ε, a, b, aa, ab, ba, bb, aaa, aab, . . . }
Lexicographc Order: {ε, a, aa, aaa, aaaa, aaaaa, . . . }

Proofs

A typical step in a proof is to derive a statement from initial
assumptions and hypotheses, or from statements that have
been derived previously, or from other generally accepted
facts, using principles of logical reasoning
We will focus on these two types of Proofs
Prove by Construction
Prove by Contradiction

Proof by Construction
Prove
For every two integers a and b, if a and b are odd, then a × b is
odd.
The above statement is in the form of P → Q where
P = a and b are odd
Q = a × b is odd

Recall the truth table of P → Q

The only chance that P → Q will be false is when P is true
and Q is false
So, we need to show that if P is true, Q is also true (cannot
be false)

Mathematics Preliminaries

Proof by Construction
Prove
For every two integers a and b, if a and b are odd, then a × b is
odd.
Assume that
a and b are integers that are ood.

Need to Derive:
a × b is odd.

Fact:
If x is an integer that is odd, there exists an integer k such
that x = 2k + 1.

Since a and b are odd integers, we can derive:
a = 2i + 1 and b = 2j + 1 for some integers i and j

Thumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu

Mathematics Preliminaries

Proof by Construction

Let a = 2i + 1 and b = 2j + 1, we have
a × b = (2i + 1) × (2j + 1)
= 4ij + 2i + 2j + 1
= 2(2ij + i + j) + 1
Thus, a × b is an odd integer since there exists an integer
k = 2ij + i + j such that a × b = 2k + 1.
Note: By showing a couple of test cases is not a proof
In the above proof, we assume that a and b can be any odd
integers

Thumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu

Mathematics Preliminaries

Proof by Contradiction

Consider the statement ¬P → False
Suppose we can show that ¬P → False is true
Recall that T → F = F and F → F = T
Since ¬P → F is true, ¬P must be false
In other words, P is true.

Thus, to show that the statement P is True, we need to show
that the statement ¬P → False is true.
From previous example, we need to assume that ¬P is true (or
P is false) and try to derive a false statement
A false statement is a statement that contradict with an
initial assumption, a hypotheses, a statement that have been
derived previously, or another generally accepted fact.

Since p2 = 2q 2 , p2 is an even number.
Since p2 is an even number, p is an even number
Since p is an even number, p = 2r for some integer r
Keep deriving:
p2 = 2q 2
(2r)2 = 2q 2
4r2 = 2q 2
2r2 = q 2
Since q 2 = 2r2 , q 2 is an even number
Since q 2 is an even number, q is an even number
