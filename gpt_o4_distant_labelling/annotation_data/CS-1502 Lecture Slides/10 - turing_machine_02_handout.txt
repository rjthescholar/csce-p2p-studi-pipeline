Turing Machine 02

Turing Machine Example

Design a Turing machine that recognizes the language B
where
B = {w#w | w ∈ Σ∗ }
On input string w:
1

2

Zig-zag across the tape to corresponding positions on either
side of the # symbol to check whether those positions contain
the same symbol. If they do not, or if no # is found, reject.
Cross off symbols as they are checked to keep track of which
symbols correspond.
When all symbols to the left of the # have been crossed off,
check for any remaining symbols to the right of the #. If any
symbols remain, reject; otherwise, accept.

0, 1 → L
A shorthand notation representing two transitions:
0 → L which is 0 → 0, L

Turing Machine Example

Design a Turing machine that recognizes the language A
where
n
A = {02 | n ≥ 0}
On input string w:
1
2
3

4
5

Sweep left to right across the tape, crossing off every other 0
If in stage 1 the tape contained a single 0, accept
If in stage 1 the tape contained more than a single 0 and the
number of 0s was odd, reject
Return the head to the left-hand end of the tape
Go to stage 1

Moving the Tape Head Back
Suppose we want to move the tape head back to the left most
end of the tape
Need a state to do that
0, 1, x → L

This will result in an infinite loop

Recall that if the tape head is at the left-most square and the
transition is L, it will stay at the same place
There is no signal telling a TM that its tape head is currently
at the left-most square

The trick is to mark the left-most symbol (depending on Γ)
Turn 0 or 1 to t
Turn 0 to 0̇ or x
Turn 1 to 1̇ or t

Designing a TM
Designing a TM in a form of a state diagram is hard
Need to keep in mind out the content of the tape
Need to worry about moving tape head

But for a simple problem, it is not that bad
Let’s create a TM that shift all symbols on the tape to the
right by one square by inserting the blank symbol at the
left-most square and move the tape head back to the
left-most square
Let Σ = {0, 1} and Γ = {0, 1, t}
Here are some input/output (on the tape)
Input
Output
01101 t01101

t0

Note that this TM always accepts all strings over Σ
