Reducibility 01

Reducibility
Reducibility is a way to convert a problem A into another
problem B where
a solution to the problem B can be used to solve problem A

Problems in our discussion are membership problems
Consider two sets A ⊆ X and B ⊆ Y and a function
f : X → Y such that
w ∈ A ↔ f (w) ∈ B
Recall that
P ↔ Q ≡ (P → Q) ∧ (Q → P )
= (¬P ∨ Q) ∧ (¬Q ∨ P )
= (Q ∨ ¬P ) ∧ (P ∨ ¬Q)
= (¬Q → ¬P ) ∧ (¬P → ¬Q)

If the above property holds, we have:
If w ∈ A, f (w) ∈ B
If f (w) ∈ B, w ∈ A

If f (w) 6∈ B, w 6∈ A
If w 6∈ A, f (w) 6∈ B

Reducibility
Again, consider two sets A ⊆ X and B ⊆ Y and a function
f : X → Y with the following property:
w ∈ A ↔ f (w) ∈ B
Problem #1: Is a specific element in the set A
Problem #2: Is a specific element in the set B
Reducibility:
Given an element w ∈ X , suppose no idea whether w ∈ A
However, given an element s ∈ Y, we know whether s ∈ B
Suppose f () exists and the above property hold
Convert w to f (w) and check whether f (w) ∈ B
If f (w) ∈ B, w ∈ A
If f (w) 6∈ B, w 6∈ A

Solution to problem #2 can be used to solve problem #1

Example

Suppose we have a sport car and we need to know whether it
can go over 200 MPH
Unfortunately, we cannot drive our car that fast in Pittsburgh
Way too many potholes

Luckily, we have a psychic lady who has a very special ability
She can tell whether an object can explode into multiple pieces

So, let’s put a bomb into our sport car
Put the trigger at the speedometer at 200 MPH mark

Take the car to the psychic lady:
If she says that it can explode
our sport car can go over 200
MPH
our sport car cannot go
If she says that it cannot explode
over 200 MPH

Reducibility 01

Example
Let’s compare the previous example with the concept of
reducibility
Let w be our sport car
Let X be the set of cars
The set A ⊆ X can be
A = {c | c is a sport car that can go over 200 MPH}
Problem #1: Is our sport car in the set A? (Is w ∈ A?)
We want to know the answer to this problem

Let Y be the set of objects
The set B ⊆ Y can be
B = {x | x is an object that can explode}
Problem #2: Is an object s can explode? (Is s ∈ B?)
The psychic lady knows how to answer this problem

Reducibility 01

Example

The function f : X → Y converts a car into an object by
strapping a bomb to the car and wire the trigger into the
speedometer
The function f () converts an instance of the problem #1 into
an instance of the problem #2 such that
w ∈ A ↔ f (w) ∈ B
Recall that we put a bomb into our car (w) and wire the
trigger to speedometer
We convert w into f (w)
We convert an instance of the problem #1 into and instance
of the problem #2

Reducibility 01

Example

Then we ask the psychic lady whether f (w) ∈ B
The answer from the psychic lady can be use to answer our
first problem because of the above property
If the psychic lady says f (w) ∈ B

w∈A

Our sport car can go over 200 MPH

If the psychic lady says f (w) 6∈ B

w 6∈ A

Our sport car cannot go over 200 MPH

Reducibility
A is reducible to B if a solution to the problem B can be used to
solve problem A.

Reducibility
Suppose B is a language
What does it mean by the psychic lady know whether an
object is in B?
B is decidable
B is decide by the psychic lady

Suppose A is a language
What happen if f () exists and the following property hold?
x ∈ A ↔ f (x) ∈ B
A is decidable by the following TM
M = “On input x where x is a string:
1
2
3

Convert x to f (x)
Run the psychic lady on input f (x)
If the psychic lady accept f (x), accept. Otherwise, reject.”

Reducibility 01

Reducibility
If B is decidable and f : Σ∗ → Σ∗ exists such that
x ∈ A ↔ f (x) ∈ B
A is decidable.
Again, let’s apply some boolean algebra:
P ≡ B is decidable
Q ≡ f : Σ∗ → Σ∗ exists such that . . .
R ≡ A is decidable

According to the boolean algebra, we have
(P ∧ Q) → R ≡ (¬R ∧ Q) → ¬P
If A is undecidable and f : Σ∗ → Σ∗ exists such that
x ∈ A ↔ f (x) ∈ B
B is undecidable.

Undecidability

How to prove that a language A is undecidable?
Use the fact that ATM is undecidable

But how?
Imagine if you can prove that
If A is decidable, ATM is decidable
The above statement is in the form of P → Q
Since P → Q ≡ ¬Q → ¬P , we have
If ATM is undecidable, A is undecidable
This allows you to conclude that A is undecidable because
ATM is undecidable

Reducibility 01

Use ATM
To show that a language A is undecidable (proof by
contradiction)
1
2
3
4

Assume that A is decidable
Show that if A is decidable, ATM is also decidable
Since ATM is decidable — contradiction
Therefore, A is undecidable

But why all the sudden ATM is decidable?
By assuming that a language A is decidable, it means there
exists a TM R that decides A
R is a decider for A
L(R) = A
R always halts
TM R can tell you whether a specific element is in A or not
If w ∈ A, R accepts w
If w 6∈ A, R rejects w

This TM R will be our helper to help us decide ATM
