Conclusion

Again, given a TM M and a string w, we know almost
nothing about them
If we construct a TM N that run M on input w, the behavior
or language of TM N depends on whether

M accepts w
M rejects w
M loops indefinitely on input w

What you have seen are some example of turning a TM M
and a string w into a new TM
