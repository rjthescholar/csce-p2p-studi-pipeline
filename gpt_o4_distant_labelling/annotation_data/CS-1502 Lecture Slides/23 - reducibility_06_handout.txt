Reducibility 06

Reductions
Recall the concept of reducibility:
A problem A is reducible to a problem B if the solution to the
problem B can be used to solve the problem A

To show that a language A is undecidable, we show that ATM
(or other undecidable language) is reducible to A
ATM is reducible to HALT TM
We want to know whether hM, wi ∈ ATM
Turn hM, wi to hM 0 , w0 i (in our case w0 = ε)
Check whether hM 0 , w0 i ∈ HALT TM
hM, wi ∈ ATM ↔ hM 0 , w0 i ∈ HALT TM

ATM is reducible to ETM
We want to know whether hM, wi ∈ ATM
Turn hM, wi to hM 0 i
Check whether hM 0 i ∈ ETM
hM, wi ∈ ATM ↔ hM 0 i 6∈ ETM

ATM is reducible to REGULAR TM
We want to know whether hM, wi ∈ ATM
Turn hM, wi to hM 0 i
Check whether hM 0 i ∈ REGULAR TM
hM, wi ∈ ATM ↔ hM 0 i ∈ REGULAR TM
hM, wi ∈ ATM ↔ hM 0 i 6∈ REGULAR TM

ATM is reducible to EQ TM
We want to know whether hM, wi ∈ ATM
Turn hM, wi to hM1 , M2 i
Check whether hM1 , M2 i ∈ EQ TM
hM, wi ∈ ATM ↔ hM1 , M2 i ∈ EQ TM

ETM is reducible to EQ TM
We want to know whether hM i ∈ ETM
Turn hM i to hM, ME i
Check whether hM, ME i ∈ EQ TM

Reductions via Computation Histories

So for we construct TMs to show that ATM is reducible to
certain languages
Another method is Reduction via Computation Histories
Generally use when the problem to be shown undecidable
involves testing for the existence of something
Given a polynomial p, does it has an integral root?
Given a set of dominoes, does it has a match?

Definitions

Recall definitions about configuration:
Suppose the start state of TM M is q0 , the start
configuration of M on input w is q0 w
An accepting configuration is a configuration uqaccept v for
strings u and v
A rejecting configuration is a configuration uqreject v for
strings u and v
A configuration Ci legally go to Cj according to the
transitions of the TM M

Reducibility 06

Reductions via Computation Histories
Definition 5.5
Let M be a Turing machine and w an input string. An accepting
computation history for M on w is a sequence of configurations,
C1 , C2 , . . . Cl where C1 is the start configuration of M on w, Cl is
an accepting configuration of M , and each Ci legally follows from
Ci−1 according to the rules of M . A rejecting computation
history for M on w is defined similarly, except that Cl is a
rejecting configuration.
Note that M must halt on input w. Otherwise, accepting or
rejection computation history does not exists
For simplicity, we only consider deterministic Turing machine
If M halts on w, exactly one computation history exists

Thumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu

Reducibility 06

Reductions via Computation Histories
Again, to show that a language A is undecidable, we show
that ATM is reducible to A
Given a TM M and a string w, there is no algorithm to check
whether hM, wi ∈ ATM because ATM is undecidable
But we know that
If M accepts w, hM, wi ∈ ATM
If M does not accept w, hM, wi 6∈ ATM

Using the concept of computation histories:
If the accepting computation history of M on input w exists
hM, wi ∈ ATM
M accepts w
If the accepting computation history of M on input w does
M does not accept w
hM, wi 6∈ ATM
not exists

Let’s try to use reduction via computation histories with a
variation of a TM called Linear Bounded Automaton (LBA)

Thumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu

Reducibility 06

Linear Bounded Automaton
Definition 5.6
A linear bounded automaton is a restricted type of Turing
machine wherein the tape head isn’t permitted to move off the
portion of the tape containing the input. If the machine tries to
move its head off either end of the input, the head stays where it is.

Linear Bounded Automaton

Problem: Given an LBA M and a string w, is there an
algorithm to determine whether M accepts w?
Formally,
ALBA = {hM, wi | M is an LBA that accepts w}
Is ALBA decidable?
This sounds like ATM
ATM = {hM, wi | M is a TM that accepts w}
Even though ATM is undecidable, ALBA is actually decidable

Thumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu

Reducibility 06

Linear Bounded Automaton

Recall a configuration uqv
uv is the content of the tape

Recall that very TM has an infinite long tape
Therefore, there are infinite number of distinct strings uv
But the tape of an LBA is finite
The length of its tape on input string w is |w|
The number of states and |Γ| of an LBA are also finite
Because of these, the set of all distinct configurations that an
LBA can have on an input string w is finite

Thumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu

Reducibility 06

Linear Bounded Automaton
Consider an LBA with the following specification:
The number of states is q
|Γ| = g (number of symbols in its tape alphabets)
The length of the tape is n

From the above LBA:
For each square on the tape, there can be one of g symbols
There are the total of g n unique tape contents

There are n possible positions of the tape head
For each tape head position, it can be in one of q states

Thus, there are exactly qng n distinct configurations
Because of this, we can detect when an LBA is entering a
loop by checking whether sequence of configurations when
running an LBA and a string w contains a duplicate

Thumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu

Reducibility 06

Linear Bounded Automaton
To detect an infinite loop in an LBA, consider an LBA M
where its series of configuration while processing w is as
follows:
C1 , C2 , C3 , C4 , C5 , C6 , C7 , C8 , C9 , C10 , C11 , . . .
What if the configuration C3 is the same as C9 ?
The content of the tape are exactly the same
The current state of M are the same
The tape head are at the same location

Thus
C10 will be the same as C4
C11 will be the same as C5
and so on

However, this method requires us to keep track of sequence of
configurations

Reducibility 06

Linear Bounded Automaton

Recall that if we run an LBA on input w for 1 step, we
already sees two configurations
The start configuration
The next configuration that legally goes from the start
configuration

Thus, if we run an LBA on input w for k steps, we already see
k + 1 configurations
Recall that the total number of distinct configurations is qng n ,
we can simply run the LBA for qng n steps or until it halts
If it does not halt after qng n steps, we already see qng n + 1
configurations
But there are only qng n distinct configurations
Thus, at least two of them must be the same (loop indefinitely)

Theorem 5.9
ALBA = {hM, wi | M is an LBA that accepts string w} is
decidable.
Construct a TM L that decides ALBA as follows:
L = “On input hM, wi, where M is an LBA and w is a string:
1
2

Simulate M on input w for qng n steps or until it halts.
If M has halted, accept if it has accepted and reject if it has
rejected. if it has not halted, reject.”

Reducibility 06

ELBA is Undecidable

Now, we just verify that ALBA is decidable
But what about the problem of determining whether an LBA
M accepts no strings (L(M ) = ∅)
Formally,
ELBA = {hM i | M is an LBA and L(M ) = ∅}
It turns out that this problem is unsolvable
In other words, ELBA is undecidable
Let’s try to prove it using the same method that we used to
prove that ETM is undecidable to try to prove that ELBA is
undecidable

Thumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu

Reducibility 06

ELBA is Undecidable
Assume that ELBA . Since ELBA is decidable, there exists a TM R that decides
ELBA . Construct a TM S (to decide ATM ) as follows:
S = “On input hM, wi where M is a TM and w is a string:
1 Construct an LBA M 0 as follows:
M 0 = “On input x:
Run M on input w.
If M accepts w, accept; otherwise, reject.”
2 Run R (a decider for ELBA ) on input hM 0 i.
3 If R accepts hM 0 i, reject. If R rejects hM 0 i, accept.”
Next, we need to prove that the TM S above, decides ATM . . .

Did you see a problem in the above prove?
M 0 (constructed by S) must be an LBA
An LBA has a finite long tape
To run TM M on input w, the LBA M 0 may need infinite
long tape
You cannot construct an LBA that can always run a TM M
on an input w
Thumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu

Reducibility 06

ELBA is Undecidable
In this case, we need to show that ATM is reducible to ELBA
using the computation history method
This method will also give you the same conclusion:
If ELBA is decidable, ATM is decidable

The idea is to construct an LBA B that accepts exactly one
string
The string will be a string representation of the accepting
computation history for M on w
Why this work?
If hM, wi ∈ ATM
M accepts w
the accepting
LBA B accepts
computation history for M on w exists
exactly one string
L(B) 6= ∅
hBi 6∈ ELBA
M does not accept w
the accepting
If hM, wi 6∈ ATM
LBA B
computation history for M on w does not exists
L(B) = ∅
hBi ∈ ELBA
accepts no strings

Reducibility 06

ELBA is Undecidable

But can we construct an LBA that accepts exactly one string
which is the accepting computation history for M on w
without requiring an infinite amount of tape?
Recall that an LBA cannot always runs M on input w because
of its finite long tape
So, can an LBA checks whether a given string is the accepting
computation history for M on w without actually run M on
input w?
It turns out, we can

Thumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu

Reducibility 06

ELBA is Undecidable
An accepting computation history for M on w is a series of
configurations C1 , C2 , . . . Cl where
C1 is the start configuration of M on input w
Cl is an accepting configuration
Ci yields Ci+1 according to M

We can represents an accepting computation history by a
single string with the configurations separated from each
other by the # symbol
#

#
C1

#
C2

#
C3

#

#
Cl

For example an accepting computation history of TM M2 in
Example 3.7 on input 0 can be represented as a single string
as follows:
#q1 0#tq2 #ttqaccept #
Thumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu

Reducibility 06

ELBA is Undecidable
With an input string x to the LBA B, the machine B must
check the following conditions before accepting x
1
2
3
4

x is in the form of #C1 #C2 # . . . #Cl # for a number l
C1 is the start configuration for M on w
Ci+1 legally follows from Ci
Cl is an accepting configuration for M

Given the definition of a TM M and a input string w:
We know the start state of M
Thus, we know the start configuration

We know the transition function of M
Thus, we can check whether Ci+1 legally follows from Ci

Accepting configuration is just uqaccept v for strings u and v

This show that there is an algorithm to check whether an
input string x is an accepting computation history for M on w
without actually running M on input w
Therefore, the LBA B can be constructed

ELBA is Undecidable

Theorem 5.10
ELBA = {hM i | M is an LBA and L(M ) = ∅} is undecidable.
For the sake of contradiction, assume that ELBA is decidable
There exists a TM R decides ELBA
Construct a TM S decides ATM as follows:
S = “On input hM, wi, where M is a TM and w is a string:
1
2
3

Construct LBA B from M and w as described in the proof idea
Run R on input hBi
If R rejects hBi, accept; if R accepts hBi, reject.”

Thumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu

Reducibility 06

ELBA is Undecidable
Sketch of the proofs:
If hM, wi ∈ ATM :
M accepts w
The accepting computation history for M on w exists
B accepts exactly one string
L(B) 6= ∅
R rejects hBi
S accepts hM, wi

If hM, wi 6∈ ATM :
M does not accept w
The accepting computation history for M on w does not exists
B accepts no strings
L(B) = ∅
R accepts hBi
S rejects hM, wi

This show that S is a decider for ATM
In other words, ATM is decidable — contradiction
Therefore, ELBA is undecidable
