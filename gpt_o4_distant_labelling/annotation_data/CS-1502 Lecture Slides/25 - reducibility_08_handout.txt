Mapping Reducibility
Definition 5.20
Language A is mapping reducible to language B, written
A ≤m B, if there is a computable function f : Σ∗ → Σ∗ , where for
every w,
w ∈ A ↔ f (w) ∈ B.
The function f is called the reduction from A to B.

Reductions
Crucial Features in a Reduction:
1

For every instance w of the first problem that we start with,
we must be able to obtain the instance f (w) of the second
problem algorithmically
In our discussion, this reduction f : Σ∗ → Σ∗ will be a TM
that produces an output string

2

The answer to the second question for the instance f (w) must
be the same as the answer to the original question for w
w ∈ A ↔ f (w) ∈ B.
In other words, for every w,
If f (w) ∈ B, w must be in A
If f (w) 6∈ B, w must not be in A

3

The reduction does not have to be one-to-one or onto as long
as it satisfies the above property

Theorem 5.22
If A ≤m B and B is decidable, then A is decidable.
Proof:
Assume that A ≤m B and B is decidable
Since A ≤m B, there exists a reduction in the form of a TM
F satisfying
w ∈ A ↔ F (w) ∈ B
Since B is decidable, there exists a TM MB that decides B
We just need to use the same method as in Chapter 4 to show
that A is decidable

Mapping Reducibility
Construct a decider N (to decide A) as follows:
N =“On input w:
1
2
3

Run TM F (a reduction from A to B) on w to produce F (w).
Run MB (a decider for B) on F (w)
If MB accepts F (w), accept. If MB rejects F (w), reject.”

Prove that if w ∈ A, N accepts w:
Assume that w ∈ A. Since w ∈ A, from the property of the reduction F ,
F (w) ∈ B. Since F (w) ∈ B and MB is a decider for B, by running MB on
input F (w), MB will accept F (w). Since MB accepts F (w), N accepts w.

Prove that if w 6∈ A, N rejects w:
Assume that w 6∈ A. Since w 6∈ A, from the property of the reduction F ,
F (w) 6∈ B. Since F (w) 6∈ B and MB is a decider for B, by running MB on
input F (w), MB will reject F (w). Since MB rejects F (w), N rejects w.

This shows that N is a decider for A
Therefore A is decidable

Theorem 5.22
If A ≤m B and B is decidable, then A is decidable.
Let the following:
P ≡ A ≤m B
Q ≡ B is decidable
R ≡ A is decidable

Since (P ∧ Q) → R ≡ (P ∧ ¬R) → ¬Q, we have
Corollary 5.23
If A ≤m B and A is undecidable, then B is undecidable.

Corollary 5.23
If A ≤m B and A is undecidable, then B is undecidable.
We already know from the fact that ATM is undecidable
Because of the above Corollary, to show that a language B is
undecidable, we just need to show that ATM ≤m B
ATM can be replaced by other undecidable language such as
ETM
To show that ATM ≤m B, we need to construct a TM F that
behaves like a reduction from ATM to B satisfying
hM, wi ∈ ATM ↔ F (hM, wi) ∈ B
Also need to prove that F actually satisfies the above property

HALT TM is undecidable
ATM and HALTTM
ATM = {hM, wi | M is a TM and M accepts w}
HALT TM = {hM, wi | M is a TM and M halts on input w}
To use mapping reducibility to show that HALT TM is
undecidable:
We need to show that ATM is mapping reducible to HALT TM
(ATM ≤m HALT TM )
Since ATM ≤m HALT TM and ATM is undecidable, from
Corollary 5.23, HALT TM is undecidable

To show that ATM ≤m HALT TM , we need a computable
function F : Σ∗ → Σ∗ (TM F ) such that
hM, wi ∈ ATM ↔ F (hM, wi) ∈ HALT TM
Note that F (hM, wi) must be in the form of hM 0 , w0 i (the
format of HALT TM )

Reducibility 08

HALT TM is undecidable

A computable function F where F (hM, wi) = hM 0 , w0 i is a
TM
A TM that takes hM, wi as its input on its tape and produces
the output hM 0 , w0 i on its tape after it is halted

Note that TM F must be a reduction from ATM to HALT TM :
hM, wi ∈ ATM ↔ F (hM, wi) ∈ HALT TM
where F (hM, wi) = hM 0 , w0 i
hM, wi ∈ ATM → F (hM, wi) ∈ HALT TM
M accepts w → M 0 halts on input w0
hM, wi 6∈ ATM → F (hM, wi) 6∈ HALT TM
M does not accept w → M 0 does not halt on input w0

HALT TM is Undecidable
Machine F computes a reduction f :
F =“On input hM, wi where M is a TM and w is a string:
1

Construct the following machine M 0 :
M 0 =“On input x:
1
2

2

Run M on w.
If M accepts w, accept. If M rejects w, enter infinite loop.”

Output hM 0 , εi.”

Next, we need to check whether TM F satisfies
hM, wi ∈ ATM ↔ hM 0 , w0 i ∈ HALT TM
where hM 0 , εi = F (hM, wi) (the output of TM F )
To do so, we need to show the following:

If hM, wi ∈ ATM , hM 0 , εi ∈ HALT TM
If hM, wi 6∈ ATM , hM 0 , εi 6∈ HALT TM

Reducibility 08

HALT TM is Undecidable
Show that
hM, wi ∈ ATM ↔ F (hM, wi) ∈ HALT TM
where F (hM, wi) = hM 0 , εi
Assume that hM, wi ∈ ATM . Since hM, wi ∈ ATM , M is a
TM that accepts w. Since M accepts w, from the definition of
TM M 0 , M 0 halts (accepts) on all strings including ε. Since
M 0 halts on ε, hM 0 , εi ∈ HALT TM . Since
hM 0 , εi = F (hM, wi), F (hM, wi) ∈ HALT TM .
Assume that hM, wi 6∈ ATM . Since hM, wi 6∈ ATM , M is a
TM that does not accept w. Since M does not accept w, from
the definition of TM M 0 , M 0 does not halt on all strings
including ε. Since M 0 does not halt on ε, hM 0 , εi 6∈ HALT TM .
Since hM 0 , εi = F (hM, wi), F (hM, wi) 6∈ HALT TM .

This show that TM F is a reduction from ATM to HALT TM
In other words, ATM ≤m HALT TM
Since ATM is undecidable, HALT TM is undecidable (Corollary
5.23)

HALT TM is Undecidable
Let’s compare two methods:
Method #1: We construct a TM S to decide ATM as follows:
S = “On input hM, wi where M is a TM and w is a string:
1

Construct a TM M 0 as follows:
M 0 = “On input x:
1
2

3

Run M on input w.
If M accepts w, accept. If M rejects w, enter infinite loop.”

Run R (a decider for HALT TM ) on input hM 0 , εi.
If R accepts hM 0 , εi, accept. If R rejects hM 0 , εi, reject.”

Method #2: Construct a reduction F from ATM to
HALT TM as follows:
F = “On input hM, wi where M is a TM and w is a string:
1

Construct a TM M 0 as follows:
M 0 = “On input x:
1
2

2

Run M on input w.
If M accepts w, accept. If M rejects w, enter infinite loop.”

Output hM 0 , εi.”

ETM is Undecidable
To show that ETM is undecidable using the mapping
reducibility, we need to show that ATM ≤m ETM
In other word, we need to find a computable function
F : Σ∗ → Σ∗ (TM F ) such that
hM, wi ∈ ATM ↔ F (hM, wi) ∈ ETM
Suppose we construct the following TM F :
F = “On input hM, wi where M is a TM and w is a string:
1

Construct TM M 0 as follows:
M 0 = “On input x:
1
2

2

Run M on input w.
If M accepts w, accept. If M rejects w, reject.”

Output hM 0 i.”

The above TM F does not satisfy the above property
It satisfies
hM, wi ∈ ATM ↔ F (hM, wi) ∈ ETM

ETM is Undecidable

TM F is a reduction from ATM to ETM
This shows that ATM ≤m ETM
By Corollary 5.23, since ATM is undecidable, ETM is
undecidable
Note that if ETM is decidable, ETM is decidable
We discussed this toward the end of Chapter 4

Therefore, ETM is undecidable

REGULAR TM is Undecidable
Use the mapping reducibility to show that
REGULAR TM = {hM i | M is a TM and L(M ) is regular} is undecidable.
Solution: We need to construct a reduction F from ATM to REGULAR TM satisfying
hM, wi ∈ ATM ↔ F (hM, wi) ∈ REGULAR TM
Construct a TM F as follows:
F = “On input hM, wi where M is a TM and w is a string:
1

Construct a TM M 0 as follows:
M 0 = “On input x:
1
2

If x is in the form of 0n 1n , accept.
If x is not in the form of 0n 1n , run M on input w. If M accepts w,
accept; otherwise, reject.”

2

Output hM 0 i.”

Next we need to show that the above TM F satisfies the property:
hM, wi ∈ ATM ↔ hM 0 i ∈ REGULAR TM
where hM 0 i = F (hM, wi) (output of TM F ):

Reducibility 08

REGULAR TM is Undecidable
Continue:
If hM, wi ∈ ATM , F (hM, wi) ∈ REGULAR TM :
Assume that hM, wi ∈ ATM . Since hM, wi ∈ ATM , M is a TM that accepts w.
Since M accepts w, from the definition of TM M 0 , L(M 0 ) = Σ∗ . Since
L(M 0 ) = Σ∗ , L(M 0 ) is regular. Since L(M 0 ) is regular,
hM 0 i ∈ REGULAR TM . Since F (hM, wi) = hM 0 i,
F (hM, wi) ∈ REGULAR TM .
If hM, wi 6∈ ATM , F (hM, wi) 6∈ REGULAR TM :
Assume that hM, wi 6∈ ATM . Since hM, wi 6∈ ATM , M is a TM that does not
accept w. Since M does not accept w, from the definition of TM M 0 ,
L(M 0 ) = {0n 1n | n ≥ 0}. Since L(M 0 ) = {0n 1n | n ≥ 0}, L(M 0 ) is not
regular. Since L(M 0 ) is not regular, hM 0 i 6∈ REGULAR TM . Since
F (hM, wi) = hM 0 i, F (hM, wi) 6∈ REGULAR TM .
This show that TM F is a reduction from ATM to REGULAR TM . Therefore
ATM ≤m REGULAR TM . Since ATM is undecidable, by Corollary 5.23,
REGULAR TM is undecidable.

EQ TM is Undecidable
We need to show that ETM ≤m EQ TM
We need to find a computable function F : Σ∗ → Σ∗ such
that
hM i ∈ ETM ↔ F (hM i) ∈ EQ TM .
where F (hM i) = hM1 , M2 i for some TMs M1 and M2
Here is the TM F :
F = “On input hM i where M is a TM:
1

Construct a TM ME as follows:
ME = “On input x:

2

Output hM, ME i.”

After proofs, we can make a conclusion that F is a reduction
from ETM to EQ TM
Therefore, ETM ≤m EQTM
Since ETM is undecidable, by Corollary 5.23, EQ TM is
undecidable

Undecidability of the Post Correspondence Problem
Earlier, we construct an instance P 0 of MPCP that has a
match if and only if M accepts w
Formally,
hM, wi ∈ ATM ↔ F (hM, wi) ∈ MPCP
where F (hM, wi) = P 0
This shows that ATM ≤m MPCP
Since ATM is undecidable, MPCP is undecidable

Then we construct an instance P of PCP that has a match if
and only if P 0 has a matchFormally,
P 0 ∈ MPCP ↔ F 0 (P 0 ) ∈ PCP .
where F 0 (P 0 ) = P
This shows that MPCP ≤m PCP
Since MPCP is undecidable, PCP is undecidable

Conclusion
The mapping reducibility can be used to show that a
language is undecidable
Corollary 5.23
If A ≤m B and A is undecidable, then B is undecidable
Since ATM is undecidable, to show that a language B is
undecidable, simply show that ATM ≤m B
Need to show that a reduction F satisfying
hM, wi ∈ ATM ↔ F (hM, wi) ∈ B
exists
Instead of ATM , other known undecidable language can be
used
