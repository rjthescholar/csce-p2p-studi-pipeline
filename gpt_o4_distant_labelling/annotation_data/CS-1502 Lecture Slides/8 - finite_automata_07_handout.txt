Finite Automata 07

Example

Show that C = {w | w has an equal number of 0s and 1s} is not
regular.
Assume that C is regular
Since C is regular, the Pumping lemma says that for any
string s ∈ C of length at least p, s can be divided into
s = xyz satisfying the following conditions:
1
2
3

xy i z ∈ C for any i ≥ 0
|y| > 0
|xy| ≤ p

Let s = (01)p
s ∈ C — good
|s| = 2p ≥ p — good

Example
Show that C = {w | w has an equal number of 0s and 1s} is not
regular.
s = (01)p
Let x = ε, y = 01, and z = (01)p−1 and check all three
conditions:
1

ε(01)i (01)p−1 ∈ C for any i ≥ 0

2

|01| = 2 > 0
|ε01| = 2 ≤ p

Every time you insert a y, you add equal number of 0 and 1
3

All three condition can be true (no contradiction)
Important: No contradiction means nothing
You also cannot conclude that C is regular

But if we pick s = 0p 1p , we will get a contradiction
Same kind of proof as in previous example but focus on the
number of 0s and 1s (no pattern)

Show that C = {w | w has an equal number of 0s and 1s}
is not regular
Assume that C is regular. Since C is regular, the Pumping lemma says that for any
string s ∈ C of length at least p, s can be divided into s = xyz satisfying the following
conditions:
1

xy i z ∈ C for any i ≥ 0

2

|y| > 0

3

|xy| ≤ p

Let s = 0p 1p . Since s starts with p 0s, to satisfy the third condition, x and y are
strings that contain nothing but 0s. In other words, x = 0j for any j ≥ 0, and y = 0k
for any k > 0. Note that k must be greater than 0 because |y| = |0k | = k, and the
condition 2 says that |y| > 0. Since x = 0j and y = 0k , z = 0p−(j+k) 1p . Let i = 2.
We have
xy i z = xy 2 z
= xyyz
= 0j 0k 0k 0p−(j+k) 1p
= 0p+k 1p
For the string 0p+k 1p to be in C, the number of 0s must be equal to the number of
1s. In other words, p + k must be equal to p. This requires k to be 0. But since k
must be greater than 0, xy 2 z 6∈ B — contradiction. Therefore, C is not regular.

Example
Show that D = {w | w has more number of 0s than number of 1s}
is not regular.
As usual, assume that D is regular and followed by the
statement from the Pumping lemma
If you pick s = 02p 1p , you will not get a contradiction
x = 0j for any j ≥ 0
y = 0k for any k > 0
z = 02p−(j+k) 1p
For i ≥ 2 in xy i z, you add more 0s which makes the result
string still have more 0s than 1s
For i = 0
xy 0 z = xz = 0j 02p−(j+k) 1p = 02p−k 1p
If k is 1, 2p − 1 > p (the number of 0s is greater than the
number of 1s) — no contradiction
If k is p − 1, 2p − (p − 1) = p + 1 > p — no contradiction
Note that 0 < k ≤ p from (2) and (3)
If there is a k that works, no contradiction

Example
Let’s try s = 1p 02p . Note that s ∈ D and |s| ≥ p.
Again, to satisfy (2) and (3), we have
x = 1j for any j ≥ 0
y = 1k for any k > 0
z = 1p−(j+k) 02p

We have xy i z = 1j (1k )i 1p−(j+k) 02p = 1p+ki−k 02p
If we increase i, we increase the number of 1s
To get a contradiction, we need the number of 1s to be
greater than or equal to the number of 0s
In other words, p + ki − k ≥ 2p
p + ki − k ≥ 2p
ki − k ≥ p
k(i − 1) ≥ p
i − 1 ≥ p/k
i ≥ (p/k) + 1
xy (p/k)+1 z = 12p 02p 6∈ D — contradiction

Show that
D = {w | w has more number of 0s than number of 1s} is
not regular
Assume that D is regular. Since D is regular, the Pumping lemma says that for any
string s ∈ D of length at least p, s can be divided into s = xyz satisfying the
following conditions:
1 xy i z ∈ D for any i ≥ 0
2 |y| > 0
3 |xy| ≤ p
Let s = 1p 0p+1 . Since s starts with p 1s, to satisfy the third condition, x and y are
strings that contain nothing but 1s. In other words, x = 1j for any j ≥ 0, and y = 1k
for any k > 0. Note that k must be greater than 0 because |y| = |1k | = k, and the
condition 2 says that |y| > 0. Since x = 1j and y = 1k , z = 1p−(j+k) 0p+1 . Let
i = 2. We have
xy i z = xy 2 z = xyyz
= 1j 1k 1k 1p−(j+k) 0p+1
= 1p+k 0p+1
For the string 1p+k 0p+1 to be in D, the number of 0s must be greater than the
number of 1s. In other words, p + 1 must be greater than p + k. This requires k to be
0. But since k must be greater than 0, xy 2 z 6∈ D — contradiction. Therefore, D is
not regular.

Rule of Thumb

If a condition of the language is about inequality (<, ≤, >,
≥), pick a string that is right at the border line to break the
condition
D = {w | w has more number of 0s than number of 1s}
1p 0p+1 needs xy 2 z to add at least one 1
0p 1p−1 needs xy 0 z to take out at least one 0
No need to find a large value of i

Example
2

Show that E = {0(i ) | i ≥ 0} is not regular.
Let’s try to understand this language first
2

If i = 0, 0(0 ) = 00 = ε
2
If i = 1, 0(1 ) = 01 = 0
2
If i = 2, 0(2 ) = 04 = 0000
2
If i = 3, 0(3 ) = 09 = 000000000, and so on

Thus, we have
E = {w | w contains nothing but 0s and
the number of 0s is i2 for some i ≥ 0}
Important: You cannot pick s = 0p
There is nothing to guarantee that p = i2 for some i ≥ 0
2
We need to pick s = 0(p )

2

Show that E = {0i | i ≥ 0} is not regular.
As usual, assume that E is regular and followed by the
statement from the Pumping lemma
2

Let s = 0(p )
Note that s ∈ E and
|s| = p2 ≥ p.

From the second and third conditions (|y| > 0 and |xy| ≤ p),
we have
0 < |y| ≤ p
Note that since s = xyz and |s| = p2 , |xyz| = p2 .

Finite Automata 07

Example

Let’s do some analysis about xy 2 z
p2 = |xyz|
|xyz| < |xy 2 z| = |xyyz| because |y| > 0
|xyyz| = |xyz| + |y| = p2 + |y|
p2 + |y| ≤ p2 + p because |y| ≤ p
p2 + p < p2 + 2p + 1 = (p + 1)2

Note that the string xy 2 z can in E if |xy 2 z| = q 2 for some q
Above analysis shows that p2 < |xy 2 z| < (p + 1)2
But there is no q such that p2 < q 2 < (p + 1)2
Thus, xy 2 z 6∈ E — contradiction
E is not regular
