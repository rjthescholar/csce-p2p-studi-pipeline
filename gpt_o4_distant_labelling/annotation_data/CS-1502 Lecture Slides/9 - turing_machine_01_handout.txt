Human Computer
Imagine a human computer working with a pencil and paper:
The only things written on the paper are symbols from some
fixed finite alphabet
Each step taken by the computer depends only on the symbol
he/she is currently examining and on his “state of mind” at
the time
His state of mind may change as a result of his examining
different symbols, only a finite number of distinct states of
mind are possible

This sounds like a finite-state machine that has its input
string written on the paper
Primitive Steps of Human Computation:
Examining an individual symbol on the paper
Erasing a symbol or replacing it by another
Transferring attention from one symbol to another nearby
symbol

A control (state diagram/transition functions)
An infinite long tape
A tape head that can move around on the tape

A Turing machine can read a symbol from the tape under the

A Turing machine can write a symbol to the tape under the
tape head
The tape head can move to the left and to the right one
square at a time
The tape is infinite
The special states for rejecting and accepting take effect
immediately (qreject and qaccept )
Unlike DFA that needs to process the last input symbol before
accepting or rejecting an input string

Example

Let Σ = {0, 1, #}
Consider the language B = {w#w | w ∈ {0, 1}∗ }
Example of strings in B are
01101#01101
#
01#01

This language is not regular
Need an infinite states to to remember all symbols in w
We can use the Pumping lemma to prove that it is not regular

If the number of # symbol in a string is not exactly 1, the
string is not in the language B

Example

Let Σ = {0, 1, #} and B = {w#w | w ∈ {0, 1}∗ }
Imaging what would you do if I give you a very long piece of
paper and it contains a string of the form x#y where
x, y ∈ {0, 1}∗ and they are so long that you cannot remember
all its symbols
One way is to go back and forth across the # and compare
symbols at the same position one symbol at a time
You may need to cross off those that have been compared

Formal Definition of a Turing Machine

A Turing machine is a 7-tuple, (Q, Σ, Γ, δ, q0 , qaccept , qreject ),
where Q, Σ, Γ are all finite sets and
1

Q is a set of states,

2

Σ is the input alphabet not containing the blank symbol t,

3

Γ is the tape alphabet, where t ∈ Γ and Σ ⊆ Γ,

4

δ : Q × Γ → Q × Γ × {L, R} is the transition function,

5

q0 ∈ Q is the start state,

6

qaccept ∈ Q is the accept state, and

7

qreject ∈ Q is the reject state.

Transition Function of a Turing Machine

The transition function of a TM is defined as:
δ : Q × Γ → Q × Γ × {L, R}
An assignment δ(q, a) = (r, b, L) means if the machine is at
state q and the tape head is over a square containing a, the
machine write symbol b (replacing a), change its state to r
and move the tape head to the left one square
This transition can be represented in a state diagram as shown
below:
a → b, L
q
r

Computation of a Turing Machine

The input string w = w1 w2 . . . wn ∈ Σ∗ is on the leftmost n
square of the tape and the rest are filled with blank symbols
The tape head starts at the leftmost square of the tape
The machine processes input according to its transition
function
If the tape head is at the leftmost square and the transition
function indicates L, the tape head stays at the same place
The machine continues until it enter the qaccept or qreject state
The machine may run forever

Tracing a Turing Machine
To trace whether a DFA accept or reject a string is easy
To trace whether an NFA accept or reject a string is harder
An NFA can split into multiple copies
Each copy has its own current state
We use a computational tree to keep track of all copies

To trace whether a TM accept or reject a string is even harder
We need to keep track or the current state (similar to DFA or
NFA)
We also need to keep track of the content of the tape
The content of the tape is changed over time (TM can write
onto the tape)

We also need to keep track of the location of its tape head
Need to know the symbol under the tape head
The tape head needs to move to either left or right direction
at every step

Configuration

When a machine process an alphabet, three things change:
the state of the machine,
the content of the tape, and
the location of the tape head

The above three items can be represented by a configuration
A configuration is in the form of u q v
u and v are strings that can be empty
q is a state that represents the current state of TM
The content of the tape is the string uv
The tape head is on the first alphabet of the string v

Configuration
We say that the configuration C1 yields configuration C2 if
the machine can legally go from C1 to C2 in one step
For example, suppose a TM has the following transition
function:
δ(qi , 0) = (qj , 1, L)
Consider the configuration 010010qi 0101
For the above configuration, u = 010010, q = qi , and v = 0101
The current state is qi
The content of the tape is 0100100101
The tape head is on top of the symbol 0 (the first symbol of v)

According to the above transition function, the next
configuration would be

01001qj 01101
We says that the 010010qi 0101 yields 01001qj 01101
Thumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu

Turing Machine 01

Configuration

Formally:
Let a, b, c ∈ Γ and u, v ∈ Γ∗
a, b, and c are symbols
u and v are strings over Γ
By concatenating the symbol a to the end of the string u, we
get the string ua

We say that
ua qi bv

yields

u qj acv

if δ(qi , b) = (qj , c, L)

Starting Configuration

Given a string w = w0 w1 w2 . . . wn
Suppose the start state of a TM M is q0
When M is about to process the string w:
q0

w0 w1 w2

wn

The starting configuration of M on input w is q0 w
Example: The starting configuration of M on input 01101 will
be q0 01101

Thumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu

Turing Machine 01

Configuration

If the state in a configuration is qaccept , the configuration is
called accepting configuration
0101qaccept 101
qaccept 1111

Similarly, if the state in a configuration is qreject , it is called
rejecting configuration
qreject 010100
011qreject 01

Once a machine yields either the accepting or rejecting
configuration, the machine will not yield any other
configuration (halting configuration).

Thumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu

Turing Machine 01

Language of a TM
A machine M accepts a string w if the sequence of
configuration C1 , C2 , . . . Ck exists, where
1
2
3

C1 is the starting configuration of M on input w,
each Ci yields Cj , and
Ck is an accepting configuration

The set of all strings A accepted by M is the language of M
M recognizes A or
L(M ) = A

Note: If L(M ) = A, it does not mean that M rejects all
strings that are not in the language A
Given a string s 6∈ A, M may loop indefinitely on input s
Unlike a DFA D, if L(D) = B, D rejects all strings not in the
language D
DFA D cannot loop indefinitely on any string

Thumrongsak Kosiyatrakul tkosiyat@cs.pitt.edu

Turing Machine 01

Language of a TM
A language B is called Turing-recognizable if some Turing
machine recognize it
Sometimes we call B is recognizable

Given a string w and a TM M there are three possibilities:
1
2
3

M accepts w
M rejects w
M loops indefinitely on input w

Turing machines that never loop indefinitely are called
deciders
These type of TMs will always halt on all inputs

A decider that recognizes a language is said to decide that
language
A language is called Turing-decidable if some Turing
machines decide it
Suppose TM M is a decider and L(M ) = C, we say that
M decides C
C is decidable
