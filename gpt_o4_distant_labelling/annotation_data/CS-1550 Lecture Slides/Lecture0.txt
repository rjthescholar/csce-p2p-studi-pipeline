Course Goal and Objectives
Continue to demystify a good portion of the magic
about how computers work so that you can write more
efficient programs
The specific objectives are:
1. Modify and compile the Linux kernel to add system
calls
2. Write multi-process/multi-thread programs free
from race conditions and deadlocks
3. Simulate page-replacement algorithms for virtual
memory management
4. Implement a user-land file system

Why is this class (notoriously) hard?
• Lots of concepts
• Attend lectures and recitations (if you absolutely cannot
attend live, watch the video recordings)
• Study often!
• Put effort into the weekly homework assignments

• Projects are relatively hard
• Refresh your C programming and GDB debugging skills
(CS 0449!)
• Start early and show up to office hours!
